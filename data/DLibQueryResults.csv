<p>As you can see it does detect 7 faces, which is correct in the image but when it tries to draw the rectangle it runs into the error. I see the error is from the win.add_overlay function.

"38782191","<p>Dlib has a really handy, fast and efficient object detection routine, and I wanted to make a cool face tracking example similar to the example <a href=""https://realpython.com/blog/python/face-detection-in-python-using-a-webcam/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>OpenCV, which is widely supported, has VideoCapture module that is fairly quick (a fifth of a second to snapshot compared with 1 second or more for calling up some program that wakes up the webcam and fetches a picture). I added this to the face detector Python example in Dlib.</p>

<p>If you directly show and process the OpenCV VideoCapture output it looks odd because apparently OpenCV stores BGR instead of RGB order. After adjusting this, it works, but slowly:</p>

<p>From the output of the timings in this program, it seems processing and grabbing the picture are each taking a fifth of a second, so you would think it should show one or 2 updates per second - however, if you raise your hand it shows in the webcam view after 5 seconds or so!</p>

<p>Is there some sort of internal cache keeping it from grabbing the latest webcam image? Could I adjust or multi-thread the webcam input process to fix the lag? This is on an Intel i5 with 16gb RAM.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong></p>

<p>According to here, it suggests the read grabs a video <em>frame by frame</em>. This would explain it grabbing the next frame and the next frame, until it finally caught up to all the frames that had been grabbed while it was processing. I wonder if there is an option to set the framerate or set it to drop frames and just click a picture of the face in the webcam <em>now</em> on read?

"8961441","<p>On AIX 6.1 ppc64, in order to load libm.a, our application uses the <code>System.loadLibrary(""m"")</code>.
Or it fails with an error message</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the module has invalid magic number</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to IBM documentation, this can happen when there is a mismatch between 32 bits and 64 bits binaries. Or this happens whether we use Java6 (32 bits) or Java6_64 (64 bits) JVM.
So it is NOT the case.</p>

<p>Another possible causes is <code>/usr/lib/libm.a</code> is NOT a shared library. But we just can't find a shared mode <code>libm.a</code> on the platform to use!</p>

<p>Acccdoring to Javadoc, in System.loadLibrary(""name"") , the mapping of ""name"" on to a real library is system dependent. On most Unix system, it is mapped to lib.so, while on AIX, it is mapped on to lib.a ; Note that on AIX, .a can be hybrid, ie. it can contain both static and shared object, 32 bits as well as 64 bits object. My problem is find a shared mode libm.a on AIX.</p>

"18731298","<p>I'm designing a modular software infrastructure from the ground up, where different DLL's hold different business logic, and application logic. Each DLL has its own mechanism of initialization / uninitialization through common DLL calls. </p>

<p>Let's say I have a host application which uses these various different DLL's. All those DLL's are loaded and initialized by the host application via <code>LoadLibrary</code>. When one DLL initializes, it instantiates some internal global variables. Can I use another DLL to connect to this one and access the same instance without routing through the host? Surely calling <code>LoadLibrary</code> from within the other DLL would create another instance, and calling the DLL directly would also not be initialized / instantiated?</p>

<p>How do I access instantiated data from one DLL to another which were initialized by the same host application?</p>

<p>For example, a database connection. I encapsulate an ADO connection inside one DLL with methods of fetching / executing, etc. I would like one DLL to use the same connection which was instantiated from the host app in this DB DLL.</p>

  <p>We will have taken the square root of all the histogram elements. That is,  <code>#feats[i]</code> is the square root of the number of LBPs that appeared in its corresponding window.</p>

"29000165","<p>I have an Executable project which uses another DLL project and loads it dynamically using <code>LoadLibrary</code> and <code>GetProcAddress</code>. On the other hand, I have another second DLL which is used by both the EXE and the first DLL, also using <code>LoadLibrary</code> and <code>GetProcAddress</code>. I have a common unit which wraps the shared DLL, and is used in both the EXE and first DLL.</p>

<p>The problem is that after the EXE has loaded this second DLL and its procedure addresses, and then the EXE loads the first DLL, then the first DLL also loads the second DLL again, so it gets loaded twice. The end result is, when the first DLL is unloaded from the EXE, it also unloads the second DLL - which was actually sharing the same instance - thus also unloading the instance known to the original EXE. This results in an <code>Invalid Pointer Operation</code> error on shutdown, because the second DLL was already unloaded (and it's trying to unload it again) as well as the EXE hanging in the background invisible (using one full processor core). </p>

<p>How do I make sure the second (shared) DLL isn't unloaded until only the EXE is terminated?</p>

<p>There are two ways I can see to accommodate for this.</p>

<p><strong>Solution 1</strong></p>

<p>Pass the <code>HMODULE</code> instance and each proc address into the first DLL when you load it, and use that instance instead of trying to load it again. However this DLL has a huge number of exported functions which need to be passed into each instance.</p>

<p><strong>Solution 2</strong></p>

<p>Add a conditional to the second DLL something like <code>IS_DLL</code> and if this conditional is defined, do not compile the freeing of the shared library. It <em>should</em> be safe to call <code>LoadLibrary</code> twice - the second time should re-use the first one.</p>

<pre><code>{$IFNDEF IS_DLL}
FreeLibrary(FModule);
{$ENDIF}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure the second solution is accurate to my assumptions, but it would be my preferred solution, since the first solution would be much more work (given the size and complexity of the DLLs). I've tried it and it works, I'm just not sure what possible issues there might be.</p>

<p>In my project the DLLs basically contain the code needed to run an AI. Another application I built allows you to write simple code and then behind the scenes it compiles the source and makes it available to the ""game"".</p>

<p>Basically I'm able to load one AI (DLL) in and watch it do its thing. The next time I send it a command to load a new AI (Separately and for a different entity) it fails. I'm using new variables for the whole process so it shouldn't be stepping on other modules.</p>

<p>Each DLL looks pretty much the same since they are all built in basically the same way. (the DLL just consists of a bunch of structs and one function). I was thinking that perhaps there is something in common in the DLLs that make it share part of the same memory in someway but I have no idea.</p>

<p>I wish I could show you the DLL source, but it's not on this machine.</p>

<p>If you have any ideas, thanks in advance!</p>

"2319030","<p>Technical summary: I'm developing a Java web service deployed on GlassFish v3, running on CentOS 5.</p>

<p>My web service uses functionality provided by a native library (.so) . The native library works fine, however I am not having much luck in configuring the environment correctly <b>to load the native library yet not be affected by web app re-deployment, without restart the app server.</b> </p>

<p>What I've done so far is:</p>

<p>Initially I loaded the library (static {System.load(path/to/libabc.so)};) in the web service code, all paths set correctly, and it works fine, until I re-deploy the application and it complains that the library is loaded by another ClassLoader. I found out that native libs are only loaded once.</p>

<p>To try and solve this I then removed the library-loading code from the web application, created a Singleton class, wrapped it into a Lifecyle module, deployed it to GlassFish shared lib folder and then configured GlassFish to run the wrapper when it starts up. The idea being that now all web applications would be able to reference it since it is not tied to one particular web app and loaded by a ClassLoader higher in the hierarchy. </p>

<p>When GlassFish starts up the native library is loaded successfully ( linux> lsof | grep libabc.so ). However, the web service code fails with a UnsatisfiedLinkError when executing the native method in my web service Java code. It seems to me that code in the web application does not have access to the library loaded at start-up.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? </p>

<ol>
<li>Convert faces to vector using trained network</li>
<li>Use Chinese whisper clustering algorithm to compute groups based on distance</li>
</ol>

<p>Chinese whisper clustering can take a pretty long time when trying to cluster a large number (>10,000) images.</p>

<p>In this <a href=""https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/09/face-clustering-with-python/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pyimagesearch</a> article the author uses DBSCAN, another clustering algorithm to group a number of images by person.</p>

<p>Since the vectors generated by the neural net can be used to calculate the similarity between two faces, wouldn't it be better to just calculate a <a href=""https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">euclidean distance matrix</a>, then search for all the values that meet a confidence threshold (eg x &lt; 0.3 for 70% confidence)?</p>

<p>Why use a clustering algorithm at all when you can just compare every face with every other face to determine which ones are the same person? both DBSCAN and chinese whisper clustering take a much longer time than calculating a distance matrix. With my dataset of 30,000 images the times are:</p>

<p>I downloaded and ran their face landmark dector: <a href=""http://dlib.net/face_landmark_detection.py.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://dlib.net/face_landmark_detection.py.html</a> and while the actual program works fine, when I try to run it on large images: </p>

<p>The code for the actual keymark extractor is here:</p>

<pre><code>win = dlib.image_window()

for f in glob.glob(os.path.join(faces_folder_path, ""*.jpg"")):
print(""Processing file: {}"".format(f))
    img = io.imread(f)

win.clear_overlay()
win.set_image(img)

# Ask the detector to find the bounding boxes of each face. The 1 in the
# second argument indicates that we should upsample the image 1 time. This
# will make everything bigger and allow us to detect more faces.
dets = detector(img, 1)
print(""Number of faces detected: {}"".format(len(dets)))
for k, d in enumerate(dets):
    print(""Detection {}: Left: {} Top: {} Right: {} Bottom: {}"".format(
        k, d.left(), d.top(), d.right(), d.bottom()))
    # Get the landmarks/parts for the face in box d.
    shape = predictor(img, d)
    print(""Part 0: {}, Part 1: {} ..."".format(shape.part(0),
                                              shape.part(1)))
    # Draw the face landmarks on the screen.
    win.add_overlay(shape)
</code></pre>

<p>And despite combing through the Dlib documentation, there's no mention of window size in ghe <code>win.set_image()</code> or the <code>win.add_overlay()</code> functions.</p>

<p>How would I make the window smaller?</p>

My question is that if I use LoadLibrary() to load the dll, is it also necessary that I have the same C Runtime? What's the potential danger if I don't?</p></li>
<li><p>I think with the /MT flag, the runtime is statically linked into the binary file. But for one of my dll project, I made a dll with /MT.

"9576118","<p>I'm working on something which dynamically loads specially formulated DLL's. I need to be able to check the DLL and make sure all the expected functions exist before I consider using this DLL. If it's missing some certain functions, I should not try to load it. I know I could attempt to call one of the functions and see if there's an exception, but I would see errors in debug mode.</p>

<p>How should I go about checking a DLL if a function exists? I'd like to check it <em>before</em> I load it (using <code>LoadLibrary</code>) but I guess it's OK if I have to load it to perform this check too.</p>

<p>I've accepted David's answer below, and thought I'd post my final code to show the whole process. I turned it into a function returning a Bool, whether it succeeded or not, cleaned the code a bit, and added another function at the bottom which uses this one to check each name one by one.</p>

Now, I need to overlay them into the image, and that's where I ran into a problem. The overlay code I got from a Matthew Earl on github:</p>

<pre><code>def annotate_landmarks(im, landmarks):
    im = im.copy()
    for idx, point in enumerate(landmarks):
        pos = (point[0, 0], point[0, 1])
        cv2.putText(im, str(idx), pos,
                    fontFace=cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SCRIPT_SIMPLEX,
                    fontScale=0.4,
                    color=(0, 0, 255))
        cv2.circle(im, pos, 3, color=(0, 255, 255))
    return im
</code></pre>

<p>Isn't integrating right with the rest of my code:</p>

<pre><code>win.add_overlay(dets)
iwl = annotate_landmarks(img, lms)
cv2.imshow(""Landmarks"", iwl)
dlib.hit_enter_to_continue()
</code></pre>

<p>And when I try to display it, it just gives me a tiny gray window with nothing in it:</p>

<pre><code>imB = im.copy()
for idx, point in enumerate(lms):
    pos = (point[0, 0], point[0, 1])
    cv2.putText(imB, str(idx), pos,
                fontFace=cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SCRIPT_SIMPLEX,
                fontScale=0.4,
                color=(0, 0, 255))
    cv2.circle(im, pos, 3, color=(0, 255, 255))

    WIDTH = 1000
    HEIGHT = 1000

    cv2.namedWindow('image', cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)
    cv2.imshow('image', img)
    cv2.resizeWindow('image', WIDTH, HEIGHT)  
</code></pre>

<p>Can someone show me what I'm doing wrong here? I need to display the points over the image, like <a href=""https://matthewearl.github.io/assets/switching-eds/landmarks.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a></p>

<p>I understand that you can use getimagesize() to get the actual pixel height and width of an image in PHP. However, if you open an image in photoshop and look at the image size dialog, you notice that there is a resolution value that determines the print size of the image.</p>

<p>Given an arbitrary jpg image file, I need to use PHP to determine this resolution number. It appears that this information is stored in the jpg file somewhere, so how do I get to it?</p>

<p>One other requirement - I only have gdlib available to me. I need to do this without the use of other php libraries (imagemagick, etc.)</p>

"6583124","<p>I'm trying to figure out the logistics for a new site that I'm creating, and one of the main issues is to get verification working correctly. One of the verification methods i'd like to incorporate is for a specific image (created via gdlib on the fly) to only work on a web page that is specified in a database field. If the image is shown on the EXACT page that is specified, then it shows the correct image, and if the link is incorrect, then it shows a different image (set by admin). The fields will be created on the admin side, and I'm trying to figure out how to get multiple instances of this working correctly. I'm using PHP and using a tag like [img src=""something_here.php""] to show my images. Any suggestions on how to set the coding to verify the site that the image is embedded into?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> So I got it working, but the request_URI command only works for the extension ""ex. login.php"", as opposed to adding in the absolute domain also. Any suggestions on how to make it factor in the whole domain address?</p>

The warnings are:</p>

Are there any ways to use concatenation layer without using alias templates or could you please make a more detailed explanation about usage of concatenation layer? Thank you in advance. </p>

<p>My question is this: suppose that an application manifest specifies specifies a particular version of a system DLL, say, comctl32.dll 6.0. In that case, will <code>LoadLibrary(""comctl32.dll"")</code> go immediately to the correct side-by-side folder, or does it still perform some kind of search?</p>

"31343483","<p>I am using loadlibrary to interface with a DLL that returns image data in a struct containing info about the size of the image and a field where the actual image data is stored:</p>

    int imageHeight;

    // horizontal size of the image [pixel]
    int imageWidth;

    // image data size [byte]

    // pointer to image data

<p>Matlab turns that into the following statement in the proto file:</p>

<pre><code>structs.ImageStruct.members=struct('imageHeight', 'int32', 'imageWidth', 'int32', 'imageSize', 'int32', 'imageBuffer', 'cstring');
</code></pre>

<p>I then instantiate such a struct using <code>str = libstruct('ImageStruct',[]) % default initialized</code> and pass it, through <code>calllib</code> to a C function which takes a pointer to such a struct and fills it with image data. The problem is that my image data can contain zeros. Matlab automatically turns the char* member into a char array, stopping at the first 0 it encounters. This means my image data gets truncated. I however know how many values there are, this is returned in the imageSize member. How do I access the whole array?</p>

<p>I have found one solution, changing the type of the <code>imageBuffer</code> member in the proto file to <code>uint8Ptr</code> and then telling matlab what number of elements should be read from the pointer:</p>

<pre><code>str.imageBuffer.setdatatype(str.imageBuffer.DataType,1,str.imageSize);

<p>My goal is to build dlib for android as a static library and create shared object as a wrap for JNI.</p>

<p>First part is compiling dlib as a static library. Here is my Android.mk:</p>

<pre><code>LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := dlib
LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/../
LOCAL_SRC_FILES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../dlib/entropy_encoder/entropy_encoder_kernel_2.cpp

LOCAL_SRC_FILES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../dlib/all/source.cpp
LOCAL_SRC_FILES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../dlib/gui_widgets/drawable.cpp
LOCAL_SRC_FILES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../dlib/gui_widgets/widgets.cpp
LOCAL_SRC_FILES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../dlib/gui_widgets/base_widgets.cpp
... cut many src files for simplicity.
LOCAL_SRC_FILES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../dlib/threads/thread_pool_extension.cpp
LOCAL_SRC_FILES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../dlib/misc_api/misc_api_kernel_1.cpp

include $(BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY)

<p>and Application.mk:</p>

APP_CPPFLAGS := -std=c++11 -frtti -fexceptions -Os

###
ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL = 15
ANDROID_NDK_HOST_X64 = true
ANDROID_SDK_TARGET = 15

<p>This works fine. I get my static library (which is 8 times bigger than when compiled with system gcc).</p>

<p>Next I'm trying to create wrap for JNI. My mod.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;jni.h&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include ""dlib/image_processing/frontal_face_detector.h""

        JNIEnv* env,
        jobject /* this */) {
    std::string hello = ""Hello from C++"";

    dlib::frontal_face_detector detector = dlib::get_frontal_face_detector();

    return env-&gt;NewStringUTF(hello.c_str());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Android.mk:</p>

<p>The function calls another function in a CLR C++ DLL. I removed almost all code in the DLL function just for a test and the exception is still thrown so I know it is my EXE function that is the issue. </p>

<p>This is the code for the EXE function to call the DLL function.</p>

<pre><code>LPCTSTR CHAXC0RDlg::Encrypt(LPCTSTR strValue)

    const char* Return;
    HINSTANCE hDLL = LoadLibrary(L""Library.dll"");

<p>This is the DLL function (as you can see I removed all code except for the code that generates a return value just as a test):</p>

<pre><code>const char* Encrypt(LPCTSTR strPValue)
{ 
    String^ strValue = gcnew String(strPValue);
    string strReturn = (const char*)(Marshal::StringToHGlobalAnsi(strValue)).ToPointer();

    char* csValue = new char[strReturn.size()];
    strcpy(csValue, strReturn.c_str());
    return const_cast&lt;const char*&gt; (csValue);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The EXE function throws the exception on ""<code>const char* Return = MethodCall(strValue);</code>"" (I enabled breaking on this exception that is how I know).</p>

<p>Why exactly is this function throwing this exception?</p>

<p>Thank You!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Update: My Character Set is UNICODE.</p>

<p>Update #2: From what I read in the suggestions and answers you are assuming this code does not work but it does. I enabled break on first-chance exceptions (and yes I do know what a first chance exception is) because I wanted this program to be good quality with all bugs gone. The code runs fine, I just wanted to figure out why the first-chance exception is being thrown because I like to be a better programmer. So I would like to fix this.</p>

<p>Update #3: I now have my code checking the values of hDLL and hMethod and both are not null when running this function. The problem seems to be in the call it self to the DLL. I am assuming the function signature is 100% correct for this code does work, it just throws a first-chance exception.</p>

<p>Update #4: I added the new changes to my function above as well added the DLL function code. The DLL function is a CLR C++ DLL. I removed all code in the DLL function as I stated already to make sure it was not my DLL.</p>

I have come to conclude that if my method is invoked 3 different times, all 3 <code>ds</code> local variables will point to a different memory adress, therefore each thread will access its local copy of TOracleDataSet and there will be no problems. If someone can confirm this I can close the question, thank you.</p>

<p>-It is possible to use in mobile/web application library dlib in order that it works in real time ? I am not familar with optimization settings and so on, that is why it is interesting how much restrictions there are.</p>

<p>The DLL pulls in additional DLLs.  If I link an executable with this DLL, then the executable dies during the initialization of the DLL.  (I can tell, there are constructors for static objects that are being called, and I can see their operation.)  I've removed ALL VS 2010-created DLLs from my path, except for one of them, which causes the error.  Replacing that one with the VS.NET-created version allows the program to run.</p>

<p>Since I'm not getting any useful information, I decided to write a test application that doesn't directly link to the DLL, but instead uses LoadLibrary to load the library.  The idea was that I could use GetLastError() to help figure the issue with the library.  No go; I get an error code -529697949, which isn't a Windows error code at all!  (If I change the DLL to the VS.NET-created version, the program loads the DLL properly.)</p>

<p>I used the Dependency Walker (www.dependencywalker.com) to check the DLL, and it tells me that ""At least one delay-load dependency module was not found,"" highlighting IESHIMS.DLL and WER.DLL.  I am seeing no other error with that tool.  Running it on the VS.NET-created DLL shows the same two warnings, so I figure this is a red herring.</p>

{
        std::wcout &lt;&lt; wmsg &lt;&lt; std::endl;

}

static void testLoadLibrary(const wchar_t *lib)
{
        ::SetLastError(0L);
        ::SetErrorMode(0);

        std::wstringstream wss;

        wss &lt;&lt; ""LoadLibrary: "" &lt;&lt; lib;
        showMessage(wss.str().c_str());
        HINSTANCE LoadME = ::AfxLoadLibrary(lib);
        if (LoadME == NULL) {
                DWORD dw = ::GetLastError();
                wss &lt;&lt; ""Failed: Error code "" &lt;&lt; dw;
                showMessage(wss.str().c_str());
                ErrorExit(lib, dw);

    fun=(DLLFUN)GetProcAddress(hdll,""add""); //----here find the add fun

    return fun(a,b);
}
return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>}
And i build and link this pdf.c with vs2010 tools but not vs2010 IDE itself:</p>

<pre><code>cl.exe /D_USRDLL /D_WINDLL C:\Users\liz\Desktop\pdfdll\Release\pdf.c /link /DLL /OUT:C:\Users\liz\Desktop\pdfdll\Release\pdf.dll
</code></pre>

<p>Then a get a <strong>pdf.dll</strong> which i want to call it using <strong>node-ffi</strong> with node.js:</p>

<pre><code>var ffi = require('ffi');
var ref = require('ref');


var intPtr = ref.refType(ref.types.int);

var libm = ffi.Library(__dirname+'\\pdf.dll', {
'dosome': [ 'int', [ 'int','int' ] ]
});

var a = libm.dosome(1,5); 
console.log(a);
</code></pre>

<p>As a result, the console.log output 0 which meaning in pdf.c program ,it fails to load the add.dll library.</p>

<p>But what is strange that when i build and link the add.c and add.h using vs2010 tool like above, it print the right answer 6.</p>

<p>So, i have tried to find what this two methods different. I use the <strong>Dependency Walker</strong> to find that the dll build with vs2010 IDE dependent with <strong>MSVCR100.DLL</strong> and <strong>KERNEL32.DLL</strong> while the dll build with cl.exe only dependent with <strong>KERNEL32.DLL</strong>.</p>

<p>In the real situation, i have a more complexer porgram which export a dll and a .h file using VS2010 IDE. I have to do some work to call this dll in my node.js program. Where am i wrong and what can I do ?</p>

"4225064","<p>My .Net program uses a fortran Dll to perform a maths function (Arpack, solves eigen modes).  I believe the fortran contains static varibles and generally isn't thread safe. Also it's very complicated and would probably take a lot of hard work to make it thread safe.  The Dll isn't very large (700K) so I just want to load it many times (say 4, or maybe 8) to allow the threads to work concurrently.  Anyone have any idea how I can do this?  I hear that LoadLibrary will always return the same handle when called multiple times.  So, as it stands my only solution is to have multiple copies of my Dll on disk (Arpack1.dll, Arpack2.dll etc) and load them as required.  Pretty horrible.</p>

<ul>
<li>let the task run in the background while waiting for the value</li>
<li>if an exception is raised, I want the main thread to catch it</li>
<li>allow the main thread to determine if the task was completed or cancelled</li>

<p>Is it possible do a non-blocking function that would do all these?</p>

"3926757","<p>I had created a small multi threaded application and I am trying to convert it to use OmniThreadLibrary. I am using the Virtualtreeview to display a log and the status/results. The Vst Log only has two columns and the record contains just two string fields (extremely simple, no objects inside the record). </p>

<p>Using a DEMO project that comes with OTL (thread pool #11) I changed the project to use a VirtualTreeview instead of the listbox. When I ""Run Task"" from the demo there is no memory leak, but if I run  ""Run Task"" more than once a memory leak will occur. A memory leak will occur if I run any task more than once. If I do not use the VirtualTreeView at all, no memory leaks occur at any time. Just when I use the VST and when a task is run more than once.</p>

<p>I do use the FreeNode event and clear the strings, and even tried using Finalize... </p>

<p>example:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TFormMain.vstLogFreeNode(Sender: TBaseVirtualTree;
  Node: PVirtualNode);
var
  LogData: PTreeLogData;
begin
  LogData:=Sender.GetNodeData(Node);

  if Assigned(LogData) then begin
    LogData^.Msgtype := '';
    LogData^.Msg := '';
  end; 
  //Finalize(LogData^);

<p>We followed <a href=""https://serverpilot.io/community/articles/how-to-run-a-simple-ftp-server.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this tutorial</a> and created an FTP server on Ubuntu 14.04 using the awesome <a href=""https://github.com/giampaolo/pyftpdlib"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pyftpdlib</a> Python library.

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>: Sorry for reopening this question, but I found memory leaks when <code>FParserThread</code> is not completed by itself by calling the <code>Terminate</code> method with enough time given... Any ideas as to what might cause the memory leaks? Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Read <a href=""http://wupingxin.blogspot.com/2011/08/note-on-omnithreadlibrary-otl.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this blog post</a>, I still couldn't figure what the problem might be, since after every steps in <code>ThreadedParse</code> the code break  if <code>Terminated</code> is ture...</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: Answering Rob's questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the OnTerminated event handler (not shown here), FParserThread is set to ""nil"", so by ""FParser is completed by itself"", I mean the <code>if FParserThread &lt;&gt; nil then</code> block is not executed, in that case FParserThread is terminated because it's parsing has been completed.</p></li>
<li><p>The logic behind the code is that, this is a code editor, upon any code edits there will be a thread being started to parse the source code into the internal tree presentation, in the case when a new code edit happens but the previous parsing thrad hasn't been edited, the program will first forcibly the previous parsing thread then start a new one. This maybe is not a good approach...</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit 4</strong>: After reading <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/4044957/133516"">this similar SO question</a>, I changed my code to call <code>FParserThread.Terminate</code> without a parameter which means, if I understand it correctly, that statement will only signal the thread to end, and inside the actual thread task, I applied the logic to exit the thread execution if the <code>Terminated</code> property is <code>True</code>. </p>

<p>Now what's wired is that, with the help of <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5498/TraceTool-12-4-The-Swiss-Army-Knife-of-Trace"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tracetool</a>, I found that after calling <code>FParserThread.Terminate</code> the <code>OnTaskMessage</code> event (where I clean up the memories) would not be fired again, that's what caused the memory leaks....</p>

"12741784","<p>I am used to create TThread descendants to do longlasting DB operations. My usual construct looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>interface
type
  TMyDBOp = class(TThread)
  private
    FConnection: TADOConnection;
    FCommand1: TADOCommand;
    FCommand2: TADOCommand; // and many more privated objects, vars ...
    procedure InitDB;
    procedure DoneDB;
    procedure DoDBStuff; // and many more procedures and functions to structure the code
  protected
    procedure Execute; override;
  public
    constructor Create; reintroduce;
    property X: T... // and many more properties to set on thread creation
  end;

implementation

constructor TMyDBOp.Create;
begin
  inherited Create(False);
end;

procedure TMyDBOp.InitDB;
begin
  FConnection:= TADOConnection.Create(nil);
  // setup all connection props, setup all other components
end;

procedure TMyDBOp.DoneDb;
begin
  FConnection.Close; // and Free, and Free all other components
end;

procedure TMyDBOp.DoDBStuff;
begin
  // Execute FCommands, do some calculations, call other TMyDBOp methods etc. etc.
end;

procedure TMyDBOp.Execute;
begin
  Try
    Coinitialize;
    InitDB;
    try
      DoDBStuff;
    finally
      DoneDB;
    End;
  Except
    // catch, log, report exceptions ....
  End;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I obviously use this class with</p>

<pre><code>var
  DBOp: TMyDBOp;
begin
  DBOp:= TMyDBOp.Create;
  DBOp.Property1:= xyz; // and set all other props
  DBOp.OnTerminate:= DBOpTerminated; // procedure to catch the thread and read back the results etc. etc.
  DBOp.Resume;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>And of course I usually set DBOp as another component var, to be able to Terminate, or WaitFor the thread.</p>

<p>Now I would like to rewrite these TThread classes and use simillar construct with OmniThreadLibrary. How should i do that? I mean: What base class to use to define all the class components and properites?
- Should it be a TOmniWorker descendant? Then where is the Execute procedure?
- Should it be a TObject descendand and the OTLTaks is then created as <code>CreateTask(DBOp.Execute)</code>?
- Should it be a TObject that I pass as a Parameter for OTLTask created as <code>CreateTask(anonymous method that reads the parameter and calls its Execute)</code>?</p>

<p>Thanks for any hint.</p>

<p>EDIT: (based on gabrs' comment on clarification)
My point is that all the samples/tests in OTL source show only a simple usage. Mostly basic ""one-procedure"" threads. For my case I need a rather complex class with subcomponents and subroutines that is all run in a thread. I am look for such a class ancestor and its design pattern.</p>

<p>...suggesting a conflict between the <code>cblas_*</code> routines mirrored in <code>MKL</code>. The documentation for <code>DLIB</code> suggests using the <code>DLIB_USE_BLAS</code> preprocessor directive in order for it to link with <code>MKL</code> but evidently it doesn't seem to help using <code>clang++</code>.</p>

<p>How do I make this work?</p>

"49478043","<p>In Delphi Berlin 10.1, I have a <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>for i := 0 to slSMP.Count - 1 do
begin

    System.StrUtils.Containstext(ExtractFileName(ExcludeTrailingPathDelimiter(slSMP.Names[i])), ThisSearchTerm) then

  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p><em>slSMP</em> and <em>slTempSearchList</em> obviously are of type <code>TStringList</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this loop takes too much time, so I decided to transform it into a <code>OtlParallel.Parallel.For</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>OtlParallel.Parallel.For(0, slSMP.Count - 1).Execute(
  procedure (i: integer)
  begin
    if System.StrUtils.Containstext(slSMP.ValueFromIndex[i], ThisSearchTerm) or

      //CodeSite.Send('TformSearchStartMenu.DoSearchFromSearchEdit: i', i);
    end;
  end);
</code></pre>

<p>STRANGELY, when the <code>CodeSite.Send</code> line is DEACTIVATED, this loop never finishes, so I had to close the application with the task manager.</p>

<p>But when the <code>CodeSite.Send</code> line is ACTIVATED, the loop finishes, but it takes LONGER than the simple <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p>So how can I make this loop faster with parallel programming?<br>
 
And why does the <code>OtlParallel.Parallel.For</code> only work when the <code>CodeSite.Send</code> line is ACTIVATED? How can I make it work without the <code>CodeSite.Send</code> line?</p>

"28545896","<p>I have a Windows Delphi application that receives events, on each of these events i'd like to run a task in a parallel way (so i can be ready for the following event). There is many way to do this through omnithread library's abstractions.</p>

<p>The issue is that part of my code needs to be executed immediately after the reception of the event (basically to ""decode"" the events params), and another part needs to be executed a few seconds after only under the condition of nothing new happend for the same context.
This behaviour should respond to ""only store this new value if it last longer than 3000ms, otherwise just cancel it"".
So what I need would be to ""cancel"" a running task (the one waiting 3000ms) if a new event arrives with the same context.
I cannot use a pipeline abstraction because when the first stage ends, it automatically fills the second stage queue without asking me if i want to cancel it or not.</p>

<p>Is that possible?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"6629852","<p>Using Delphi XE.</p>

<p>When trying to access a Delphi interface object from a DLL, it fails if I try to do it dynamically versus statically.</p>

<p>The interface unit in the dll implements a function to return an instance of the interface.  When linked statically, the result is nil when entering the function and everything works.  When loading dynamically, the result is non-nil, so when the assignment to result is being done, the IntFCopy code sees it as non-nil and so tries to free it before the assignment, which raises an exception.</p>

<p>Any insight would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The DLL includes testinterfaceload_u and exports testInt:</p>

<pre><code>library testinterfaceload;

uses
  SimpleShareMem,
  SysUtils,
  Classes,
  testinterfaceload_u in 'testinterfaceload_u.pas';

{$R *.res}
exports testInt;

begin
end.
</code></pre>

<p>testinterfaceload_u is the unit that defines the interface and simple class implementation:</p>

<pre><code>unit testinterfaceload_u;

interface

type ITestInt = interface
 procedure Test;
end;

{this function returns an instance of the interface}
function testInt : ITestInt; stdcall; export;

type

TTestInt = class(TInterfacedObject,ITestInt)
 procedure Test;
end;



implementation

function testInt : ITestInt;
begin
//debugger shows result as non-nil ITestInt even before this assignment, when dynamic
  result := TTestInt.Create;  
end;

procedure TTestInt.Test;
var
  i : integer;
begin
  i := 0;
end;



end.
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a console app that loads the dll and calls the testInt function to return the interface:</p>

<pre><code>program testload_console;

"4213295","<p>I am working on a Qt DLL that is used as a plugin for a large application.  This DLL depends on other DLLs that are sadly not located in the same folder and hence will only load if the current working directory has been set correctly (which the large application does prior to calling <code>LoadLibrary</code> on the DLL).  I have no control over this behaviour.</p>

<p>I have been asked to add a simple COM object to this plugin which I have done but I now have the problem that the DLL cannot be registered or used by a 3rd-party application unless the current working directory is set correctly - because any <code>LoadLibrary</code> calls on the plugin fail due to the missing dependencies.  Obviously I have no control over the current working directory used by 3rd-party apps and at this stage I am not allowed to modify the PATH to ensure the dependencies can be found.</p>

<p>I have tried using <code>/DELAYLOAD</code> for the dependent DLLs but this fails with 'cannot delay-load foo.dll due to import of data symbol...' errors.  Again, I cannot easily change the way these dependent DLLs are used.</p>

<p>Currently I think the only solution is to move the COM object into a stand-alone DLL that doesn't depend on anything else but I am under pressure to find a solution and leave the COM object in the plugin DLL.  I can't see how this is possible so I thought I'd see if anyone else has any ideas.  Some form of system-wide <code>SetDllDirectory</code> call would help or some registry hack that could set the working directory when a 3rd-party app calls <code>LoadLibrary</code> on my plugin.</p>

<p>Would somebody be so kind and enlighten me please?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
I've narrowed down the issue to a memory management library that is linked in from another dll that my program uses. The dll that it uses is sh33w32.dll, it's called SmartHeap and is by a company named Microquil I think. I have version 3.3, and when Java LoadLibrary tries to load that dll, it fails. I'm not sure what I could do to have java handle loading that library. It must have something to do with the area of memory that Java can access, versus what windows allows an exe to access. The exe has no problem with the SmartHeap library, but Java will not allow me to use it. Any ideas or experience dealing with this? I've tried to remove the linked library by recompiling the other libraries, but then the normal calls in the code fail that normally work. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Additional Information Found</strong>
The function that is in the dll that fails to load in java is called MemRegisterTask. It's from a product called SmartHeap by Microquill. Here is the documentation I found about this function. I think this memory allocation is what causes java to fail to load it.</p>

<p>MemRegisterTask initializes the SmartHeap Library. On most platforms, you don’t need to call MemRegisterTask because SmartHeap will initialize itself when you make the first call.</p>

<p>SmartHeap maintains a registration reference count for each task or process. Each time you call MemRegisterTask, this reference count is incremented. If your last call to SmartHeap occurs before your application is ready to terminate, you can call MemUnregisterTask to terminate SmartHeap. MemUnregisterTask decrements the registration reference count by one — when the count is zero, SmartHeap will free any SmartHeap-allocated memory and debugging state associated with the current task or process.</p>

"54633033","<p>I implemented simple linear regression in <a href=""http://dlib.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dlib</a> as a single-layer perceptron with MSE-loss with a single output. The network type is:</p>

<pre><code>dlib::loss_mean_squared&lt;dlib::fc&lt;1,dlib::input&lt;dlib::matrix&lt;float&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to modify the loss function to add L1 regularizer. Is there a simple way to do it? As I understand, there's no ready-to-use loss layer for that in Dlib?  </p>

<p>Also, is it ok to implement linear regression in Dlib this way, or are there more appropriate primitives in Dlib that would calculate regression coefficients analytically, e.g. like <code>LinearRegression</code> or <code>Lasso</code> from scikit-learn?</p>

<p><strong>UPD:</strong> Seems like <a href=""http://dlib.net/ml.html#rr_trainer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dlib::rr_trainer</a> (ridge linear regression, L2 regularization) is roughly what I need. But I can't find out how to make it predict multiple outputs. If I supply a vector of samples as a second argument to <code>train()</code> function, where each sample is a column-matrix <code>dlib::matrix&lt;N,1&gt;</code> of target outputs, it segfaults. So far it worked only for a single output, i.e. each output sample is a <code>float</code>.</p>

<p>If the resolution issue wasn't a big deal I would go about it this way:</p>

<li>Simple image upload</li>
<li>Use jquery to crop photo to correct dimensions</li>
<li>Mess around with gdlibrary and imagettftext() to get the text onto an image (page)</li>

"48989632","<p>Dlib has recently released a new method for global optimization, minimizing the number of function calls (<a href=""http://blog.dlib.net/2017/12/a-global-optimization-algorithm-worth.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blog.dlib.net/2017/12/a-global-optimization-algorithm-worth.html</a>)</p>

<p>I would like to use this in Python, and for a simple cost function it works well:</p>

<pre><code>import dlib
import numpy as np

def cost_fn_2_params(x0, x1):
    return np.sum([x0, x1])

dlib.find_max_global(f=cost_fn_2_params, bound1=[-1., -1], 
                     bound2=[1., 1], num_function_calls=10)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in my particular use-case I have a variable number of parameters going in to my cost function, and <code>find_global_max</code> expects the cost function to have a static number of arguments. For example, defining the cost function in another way:</p>

<pre><code>def cost_fn_unspecified_params(**params):
    return np.sum(params)

dlib.find_max_global(f=cost_fn_unspecified_params, bound1=[-1., -1], 
                     bound2=[1., 1], num_function_calls=10)
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Failing expression was num == args.size().
The function being optimized takes a number of arguments that doesn't agree with the size of the bounds lists you provided to find_max_global()
</code></pre>

<p>My question is: Is there any way to dynamically define functions with a certain number of arguments? Excluding the <code>*params</code> syntax as this apparently looks like a single argument to <code>dlib</code>.</p>

<p>I have considered using <code>exec</code> to define a function, but it seems overly complicated. This is my best solution so far:</p>

<pre><code>def get_fn_n_arguments(n):
    argument_list = [f'x{ii}' for ii in range(n)]
    argument_str = ','.join(argument_list)
    def_str = f'def fn({argument_str}): \n\tparams = [{argument_str}]\n\treturn cost_fn_unspecified_params(params)'
    print(def_str)
    exec(def_str, globals())
</code></pre>

<p>This puts a function <code>fn</code> into the global namespace, and now I can do </p>

<pre><code>get_fn_n_arguments(2)
dlib.find_max_global(f=fn, bound1=[-1., -1], 
                     bound2=[1., 1], num_function_calls=10)
</code></pre>

<p>It works, but it seems like a very brittle solutions. I would really like to improve it.</p>

<p>Actual situation: I have a dispatcher which, depending on some messages, needs to load one of several dll's and execute some function from them. I can't link against them at compile time, so I use <code>LoadLibrary</code>. Because there can potentially be a lot of calls, I'd prefer not to have to call <code>LoadLibrary</code> every time, since it turns out it's a bottleneck. So I was thinking to only call it once per DLL, calling <code>GetProcAddress</code> to get the function also only once per dll, and cache it somewhere. But is it safe?

"10487778","<p>I´m trying to load libtiff 3.9.5 in MATLAB R2012a and the situation is: Matlab says I need a Compiler and Perl. I installed Visual Studio 2010 and perl 5.14.2. mex -setup says Compiler is ok but nothing about Perl. Running loadlibrary I got lots of errors ( input character not valid and unkown variable among them). I found that Matlab looks for shrlib.dll in Windows Systems so I get a libtiff.dll in the Internet, use it and nothing changes. Next I get Big TIFF libtiff 4.1 which has a libtiff.lib and no changes again. As I am new in Matlab I just can´t think of what to do anymore. So I ask if somebody will help me. Many thanks in advance and best regards.</p>

<p>P.S. I put libtiff folder in R2012a directory a made it Current Folder. </p>

<p>I think this is a separate issue from the first one, but idk, maybe they are related?  For this issue, I've tried doing what was mentioned here <a href=""https://github.com/davisking/dlib/issues/57"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/davisking/dlib/issues/57</a>   I made the link for the first part, then added these lines to my cmakelist.txt</p>

<pre><code>include_directories(../../../../usr/X11/lib)
include_directories(../../../../usr/local/include)
include_directories(../../../../usr/local/lib)
</code></pre>

<p>Didn't seem to fix the issue though.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong>  So I think both these issues are resolved now.  I think added those include_directories lines that I mentioned above help.  Also, I started using cmake from the command line, instead of with clion. </p>

<p>However, I am now getting a new error :/</p>

"55093732","<p>Hopefully a simple one.  I am using an OTL Parallel.For loop to process lots of data.  The amount of data can change and if there is a lot (that takes over 2 seconds) Windows flickers the application form and gives a temporary ""not responding"" status in the title bar.</p>

<p>To get around this I thought I could put the procedure with the Parallel.For loop inside an OTL Async call, like</p>

<pre><code>done:=false;
Async(ProcedureThatDoesParallelFor).Await(
procedure begin
done:=true;
end);
repeat application.processmessages until done=true;
</code></pre>

<p>This works (or seems to work) but can lead to the program just aborting/exiting without any error messages.  It only seems to cause the silent abort problem when the Parallel.For loop is very quick to run.</p>

<p>If I remark the above code and take the call to ProcedureThatDoesParallelFor outside of it the app runs fine without unexpected quitting, so I am assuming it must be the Async call causing the problem.  Or a combination of Parallel.For within Async?</p>

<p>Is using Async the best way to run another procedure and wait for it to finish?  Is there a better OTL way of doing this?</p>

<p>AsyncParallelFor shows the basic nested loops.  Just a simple addition in there to demo the issue.</p>

<p>AsyncProcedure does the OTL Async call and waits for the return.</p>

<p>I have a lot of non parallel code before and after the call to AsyncProcedure that need to wait for the parallel.for loop to finish.</p>

<p>If I change the button click to call AsynParallelFor directly without the Async then there is no hang.</p>

<p>I am aware that other images need to be added to the training in order to have better results but before doing that I want to be sure of the meaning of every parameter printed in the result (precision, recall, AP, c, eps, ...) I am also wondering if you have any recommandations regarding the training : what images to choose ? how many images are needed ? Do I need to annotate every object in the image ? Do I need to ignore some regions in the image ? ...</p>

<p>One last question, is there any trained detector (svm file) that I can use to compare my results ?</p>

<p>Thank you for your answers</p>

<p>I tested it in Delphi,works fine,but C# - no.</p>

<p>I wrote additional code to make my check easier in C#.</p>

            Misc.LogToFile(""error"", true);

        }

<p>It doesn't need C++ runtime,because Its compiled with the libraries and it works in Delphi on Vista,but not C#.</p>

<p>Where could the problem be?</p>

<p>Once the object is created in the main thread the user sent to a processing queue (this is where I send it to a <a href=""http://otl.17slon.com/book/doku.php?id=book%3ahighlevel%3apipeline"" rel=""nofollow"">OmniThread Pipeline</a>) and perform the following stages:</p>

<li><strong>Stage 2)</strong> Send this document to a WebService which performs some other calculations to it, save the result to the database (I am ensuring of calling CoInitialize/CoUninitialize) &lt;- This stage can fail due to internet timeouts, web service errors, web service maintenance windows, etc. need to handle those.</li>

<li>¿Should I use a Lock when performing the database updates?</li>

One platform-independent library which should be available for both, a CF project and a desktop project. This common library contains the code for extracting ZIP-files. The problem is that there are two different DLLs of the DotNetZip library, one for .NET CF and one for the .NET Desktop Framework. It's not possible to use the CF version of the library on a Desktop Framework and vice versa but they share the same interface.</p>

<li><p>LoadLibraryW fails (returns nullptr) when given a valid path.</p></li>
<li><p>Process Monitor records no suspicious failures, or indeed anything different from when it succeeds in loading the dll (which it can in another context).</p></li>
<li><p>The dll has no non-system dependencies.</p></li>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I think some people have wanted more details on the failure itself:</p>

<ul>
<li>It does not appear to be the input - it is identical in the working and failing version, and LoadLibraryW has successfully declared ""file does not exist"" when the input string has been mutilated.  The current input has it hard-coded in, leaving little room for error.</li>
<li>The dll is compiled in Release and the calling code in Debug.  I've been doing this for 18 months without a problem, but you never know.</li>
<li>The Process Monitor package reports about 30 internal operations running within LoadLibraryW, including CreateFile, LoadImage, RegOpenKey.  These are <em>identical</em> for the working call and the failing call, down to the sizes of files and the memory locations.</li>
<li>There's no obvious memory corruption in the C++ object calling it, and as I said, Process Monitor gives the same Base Image address in both cases.</li>
<li>The failure's 100% consistent - same time, same place every time.</li>

<p>Now the strange thing is: sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't work it crashes when it loads foo.dll. I run it in debug mode but I don't even get an exception. The debugger just stops as if I stopped it myself!</p>

<p>I also tried to load foo.dll in the same stack frame where I load cygwin1.dll. Same thing!</p>

<p>Any hints why this happens and what I can do to make it work?</p>

<p>Update 1: We use the latest cygwin and Visual Studio 2010.</p>

<p>Update 2: An assumption is that it has to with timing and garbage collection. It seems to me that the time between loading cygwin1.dll and loading foo.dll matters. The shorter the time between the two LoadLibrary calls the more likely it seems to work.</p>

<p>Update 3: If loading foo.dll succeeds the first time it succeeds always during a session. I can click button1 as often as I want.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> LoadLibrary(""foo.dll"") does not simply fail to load foo.dll. That'd be nice. I <strong>crashes</strong> and the debugger stops working. Not even an exception is thrown. <strong>AND</strong> it does not crash always. Sometimes it works!</p>

<p>The last line does not compile as <code>get_scanner()</code> returns <code>const image_scanner_type &amp;</code>. So changing <code>max_pyramid_levels</code> won't work. I would like to know if there is a way to change that in order to scan less images (ie. The pyramid will have less images). </p>

<p>My goal is to enhance the performance of the detector and in my case I'm sure that only few image scales in the pyramid are needed.</p>

"10255055","<p>I have an application that runs as a WCF webservice on IIS7. It calls a COM control and this control then loads another dll with data. This application has been in use for quite a while and normally works fine, but recently I ran into a problem on one machine where the LoadLibrary call to load the data dll fails. However, the call doesn't always fail, it will work for the first call after the IIS service is restarted, and then fails after that. </p>

<p>The data dll exists in the same directory as the COM control, and the current directory is set to this directory. I've checked and the current directory does not get set to another directory, it stays the same for both calls. The separate calls are separate calls to the webservice and in between them the com control gets unloaded, as does the data dll. </p>

<p>The data dll loads fine if I place it in the system directory or use the full path to the dll in the com directory, so I can work around this, but I'm just wondering why it would happen. When I call GetLastError after it fails to load the module, as I mentioned it just gives me 'The specified module could not be found' error.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682586%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""DLL Search Order"">MSDN description</a> for LoadLIbrary says that the current directory should be searched and all the other installations where this has worked seems to suggest that it normally does. The machine that it's failing on is a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine, although the application has been run on this type of machine many times before.</p>

<p>Any ideas are welcome. Is there a way to get LoadLibrary to enumerate where it's looking?</p>

"11206999","<p>I have to create a wrapper DLL that exports some symbols (functions). Within its resources it contains another <strong>encrypted</strong> DLL that actually does the job.</p>

<p>Upon the wrapper DLL initialization it decrypts the original one, saves it in a file, and loads into the address space by <code>LoadLibrary</code>. However I'd like to avoid saving this DLL in a file.</p>

<p>I know that this doesn't guarantee a bullet-proof protection, actually one may dump the process virtual memory and see it there. I also know that it's possible to create a file with <code>FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code> attribute, which ensures this file will be deleted as soon as the process terminates. But still I'd like to know if there's an option to load the DLL ""not from a file"".</p>

<p>So far I thought about the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Allocate a virtual memory block with adequate protection (<code>PAGE_EXECUTE_READ</code> or <code>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</code>). Preferrably at the image preferred base address.</li>
<li>Extract/decrypt the DLL image there.</li>
<li>If the image base address isn't its preferred address - do the relocation ""manually"". I.e. - analyze the relocation table and patch the image in-place.</li>
<li>Handle the image imports. Load its dependency DLLs and fill symbol addresses.</li>
<li>Invoke its initialization function (<code>DllMain</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>That is, I can do the work of the loader. But unfortunately there are some areas where the DLL loaded by the above trick will behave differently, since it's not a properly-loaded DLL from the OS's perspective. This includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>DllMain</code> requires the DLL ""module handle"", which is just its base address. It may use this handle in calls to various API functions, such as <code>LoadResource</code>. Those calls will probably fail.</li>
<li>There will be problems with exception handling. The OS won't see the DLL's <code>SAFESEH</code> section, hence its internal exception handling code won't be invoked (it's a 64-bit DLL, means <code>SAFESEH</code> is <strong>mandatory</strong> for exception handling).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's my question: Is there an API to properly load the DLL into the process address space without the need for it to be in a file? An alternative variant of <code>LoadLibrary</code> that works, say, on a file mapping instead of a file-system file?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

"47120993","<p>Suppose we have two dynamic libraries <code>libfoo.dll</code> and <code>libbar.dll</code>, given that <code>libbar.dll</code> depends on <code>libfoo.dll</code>. Further we compile an executable <code>test.exe</code> that loads our <code>libbar.dll</code> using WinAPI function <code>LoadLibrary()</code>.  </p>

<p>If we run <code>text.exe</code> on Windows XP with missing <code>libfoo.dll</code>, <code>LoadLibrary()</code> shows dialog box alerting than <code>libfoo.dll</code> is actually missing and sets <code>LastError</code> to <code>ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND</code> (126).  </p>

<p>If we run same <code>text.exe</code> in same conditions on Windows 10, <code>LoadLibrary()</code> sets <code>LastError</code> to <code>ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND</code> only, no dialog box appears.  </p>

<p>In both cases <code>ErrorMode</code> is 0. So is there any possibility to catch a name of missing dependency in <code>LoadLibrary()</code> calling process, or, at least, how to make  <code>LoadLibrary()</code> show error dialog on Windows 10?  </p>

"38391746","<p>I am currently trying to build and use the <em>dlib-android</em> library which aims to port <em>dlib</em> to Android. Building is successful; but when using the compiled shared C++ library in the corresponding demo project <em>dlib-android-app</em>, the app crashes when starting to invoke library functions through JNI.</p>

<p>This runtime crash occurs for any build I perform locally, using an arbitrary NDK version on OSX or Debian. However, the crash cannot be reproduced using the pre-built version of <em>dlib-android</em> that is contained in the <em>dlib-android-app</em> project. Also, the project maintainer states that he cannot reproduce the issue.</p>

<p>What factors could cause my local builds to turn out erroneous on two different operating systems while the project maintainer can create a functional build using the same codebase and build procedure? Could it be that global compiler flags could cause this issue?</p>

<p>I read that I should use a cancellation token, but I cannot find an example of some sort on how to use it.</p>

<p>This is the original for loop inside the function.</p>

<pre><code>function SomeFunction() : string;
begin

  for value :=  0 to length(listOfThings)-1 do
  begin

    Chain := Function1( listOfThings[value] );

    if Evaluate( Chain , Solution) then

    else
    begin
      Result := 'ERROR';
      exit;
    end;
  end;
end;

<p>And this is how I am using the Parallel.ForEach</p>

<pre><code>function SomeFunction() : string;
begin

  Parallel.ForEach(0, length(listOfThings)-1 ).Execute(

    procedure (const value: integer)
        var Chain : string;
        begin
          Chain := Function1(listOfThings[value]);

        if Evaluate(Chain , Solution) then

        end
  );
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the Parallel.ForEach I can't do <code>Result := 'ERROR'</code> because it is not captured inside the procedure, so I think if I can cancel the Parallel.ForEach and report that cancellation, then I can just assign <code>Result := 'ERROR'</code> outside.</p>

"39941690","<p>We are trying to understand some of the finer details of locating a symbol at runtime. I've already reviewed Jeffrey Richter's <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1572319968"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows</a>, Chapters 19 (<em>DLL Basics</em>) and 20 (<em>DLL Advanced</em>). Richter is a bit more comprehensive and more cohesive than MSDN.</p>

<p>We are trying to combine implicit library linking with dynamic symbol location. We want to avoid calls to <code>LoadLibrary</code> because of some of the potential security hazards. We are also trying to avoid loader lock issues <em>if</em> a user wanders into doing too much in a <code>DllMain</code> function.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cxx prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#pragma comment(lib, ""kernel32"")

extern ""C"" {
  typedef BOOL (WINAPI * PFN_GOR)(HANDLE, LPOVERLAPPED, LPDWORD, BOOL);
  typedef BOOL (WINAPI * PFN_GORX)(HANDLE, LPOVERLAPPED, LPDWORD, DWORD, BOOL);
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    HINSTANCE hInst = GetModuleHandle(""kernel32"");
    PFN_GOR pfn1 = hInst ? (PFN_GOR)GetProcAddress(hInst, ""GetOverlappedResult"") : NULL;
    PFN_GORX pfn2 = hInst ? (PFN_GORX)GetProcAddress(hInst, ""GetOverlappedResultEx"") : NULL;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""kernel32: "" &lt;&lt; std::hex &lt;&lt; (void*)hInst &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""GetOverlappedResult: "" &lt;&lt; std::hex &lt;&lt; (void*)pfn1 &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""GetOverlappedResultEx: "" &lt;&lt; std::hex &lt;&lt; (void*)pfn2 &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We kind of got lucky with <code>GetOverlappedResult</code> and <code>GetOverlappedResultEx</code> because <code>kernel32.dll</code> provides both of them regardless of the platform. <code>kernel32.dll</code> has another nice property because every Windows application links to it, and there's no way to disgorge it.</p>

<p>Random numbers from the platform appear to be a little more troublesome. On Windows 7 and below we have <code>CryptGenRandom</code> from <code>advapi32.dll</code>; while Windows 10 and above uses <code>BCryptGenRandom</code> from <code>bcrypt.dll</code>. Windows 8 is a grey area because some versions, like Windows Phone 8, do not offer anything. We believe we can guard inclusion of a library based on <code>WINVER</code> or <code>_WINNT_VER</code>.</p>

<p>I feel like the pattern of implicit library linking combined with <code>GetModuleHandle</code> and <code>GetProcAdress</code> is unusual but it meets our requirements. Its unusual because it uses implicit linking and <code>GetModuleHandle</code> rather than <code>LoadLibrary</code>. I also cannot find text that forbids implicit linking and <code>GetModuleHandle</code>.</p>

<p>It meets our requirements because we will not be responsible for insecure library loading due to binary planting and other DLL redirection tricks. We will also avoid DoS'es from accidental mis-use by doing too much in a <code>DLLmain</code>.</p>

<p>My question is, is the code a legal combination or pattern. If its a defective pattern, then what is the defect?</p>

I'm going to use dlib, which is a fantastic tool, that helped me in a few optimization problems before. In line 748 of Github repo (<a href=""https://github.com/mzucker/page_dewarp/blob/master/page_dewarp.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/mzucker/page_dewarp/blob/master/page_dewarp.py</a>) Matt uses optimize function from Scipy, to find the minimal distance between two vectors. I think, my C++ equivalent should be solve_least_squares_lm() or solve_least_squares(). I'll give a concrete example to analyze.</p>

<p>My data:<br>
a) dstpoints is a vector with OpenCV points - <code>std::vector&lt;cv::Point2f&gt;</code> (I have 162 points in this example, they are not changing),<br>
b) ppts is also <code>std::vector&lt;cv::Point2f&gt;</code> and the same size as dstpoints.</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;cv::Point2f&gt; ppts = project_keypoints(params, input);
</code></pre>

<p>It is dependent on:<br>
- <code>dlib::column_vector</code> 'input' is 2*162=324 long and is not changing,<br>
- <code>dlib::column_vector</code> 'params' is 189 long and its values should be changed to get the minimal value of variable 'suma', something like this:</p>

<pre><code>    double suma = 0.0;
    for (int i=0; i&lt;dstpoints_size; i++)
    {
        suma += pow(dstpoints[i].x - ppts[i].x, 2);
        suma += pow(dstpoints[i].y - ppts[i].y, 2);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm looking for 'params' vector that will give me the smallest value of 'suma' variable. Least squares algorithm seems to be a good option to solve it: <a href=""http://dlib.net/dlib/optimization/optimization_least_squares_abstract.h.html#solve_least_squares"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://dlib.net/dlib/optimization/optimization_least_squares_abstract.h.html#solve_least_squares</a>, but I don't know if it is good for my case.<br>
I think, my problem is that for every different 'params' vector I get different 'ppts' vector, not only single value, and I don't know if <code>solve_least_squares</code> function can match my example.<br>
I must calculate residual for every point. I think, my 'list' from aforementioned link should be something like this: </p>

<pre><code>(ppts[i].x - dstpoints[i].x, ppts[i].y - dstpoints[i].y, ppts[i+1].x - dstpoints[i+1].x, ppts[i+1].y - dstpoints[i+1].y, etc.)
</code></pre>

<p>, where 'ppts' vector depends on 'params' vector and then this problem can be solved with least squares algorithm. I don't know how to create data_samples with these assumptions, because it requires <code>dlib::input_vector</code> for every sample, as it is shown in example: <a href=""http://dlib.net/least_squares_ex.cpp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://dlib.net/least_squares_ex.cpp.html</a>.<br>

"28056262","<p>We have a .NET library that platform invokes native code, specifically we call LoadLibrary().  This code has been in place for a while, but a new user has noticed when running as a Terminal Services user of a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine that it fails to run (apparently when LoadLibrary is called).  This happens when run as a Standard User but not when run as an admin which is suspicious.  Also it works when run on a Windows Server 2003 machine.</p>

<p>Now we've tested running on a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine and not had any issues before.</p>

<p>I'm suspicious that UAC is at play here.  We had them use Process Monitor and I noticed the result INVALID PARAMETER when DeviceIOControl() is called with the control code IOCTL_MOUNTDEV_QUERY_DEVICE_NAME.  Which also makes me suspicious of a mapped drive, though running the same code on a mapped drive on my machine works just fine.</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install numpy
$ pip install scipy
$ pip install scikit-image
$ pip install dlib

<p>Unlike the instructions, the last line took a few seconds, not 15 minutes. After the installation, I opened <code>ipython</code> and tried <code>import dlib</code>, and receive this message:</p>

<p>I assume this means <code>dlib</code> is not properly installed, but I am not sure what I did wrong? </p>

<p>Also, I should add that I do not have<code>anaconda</code> on my mac, so it cannot be the issue. However earlier today I did, and I could load <code>dlib</code> without an issue, presumably because I am running a version of python distributed by <code>anaconda</code>, and I assume <code>dlib</code> comes with <code>anaconda</code>. However the <code>X11</code> distributed by <code>anaconda</code> is broken so I had to remove <code>anaconda</code> completely from my system and start over. </p>

<p>My goal is to run this example. I want to see output image (Facial landmarks)</p>

<p><strong>My attempt to find a solution</strong></p>

<p><strong>First attempt</strong></p>

<p>I think that I have problem in dlib.</p>

<p>I run this code:</p>

<pre><code>print(""Hello world"")
</code></pre>

<p>output: Hello world</p>

<pre><code>import cv2
import dlib
import imutils
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()
image = cv2.imread(""/home/mnt/Kernel/p.jpg"" )
image = imutils.resize(image, width=500)
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
rects = detector(gray, 1) 
</code></pre>

<p>I can not enter other commands after this. If I run print(""Hello world"") I will see nothing.</p>

<p>You can see this in screeshot:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HZE1o.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HZE1o.png"" alt=""Error in dlib""></a></p>

<p>I think that this is error in dlib function rects = detector(gray, 1). </p>

<p>But I don't know how to solve this problem.</p>

<p><strong>Second attempt</strong></p>

<p>I wrote a letter to creater dlib but He wrote ""<em>I should also point out that you should run the face_detector.py example that comes with dlib. Does that crash or act funny? If not then the problem is almost certainly with some other thing you are doing or have installed, rather than anything related to dlib</em>"".</p>

"9070142","<p>I just discovered OmniThreadLibrary &amp; started playing with it. I'm trying to launch, say, no more than 20 tasks max and send the rest of the tasks to queue.</p>

<p>I modified the OmniThreadLibrary's <strong>00_Beep</strong> project to do this:</p>

<pre><code>const
  TASKS_COUNT = 100;

procedure TfrmTestSimple.btnBeepClick(Sender: TObject);
var
    I: Integer;
begin
    with OmniEventMonitor do
        for I := 1 to TASKS_COUNT do
            Monitor(CreateTask(Beep, 'Beep-' + IntToStr(I))).Schedule;
end;

procedure TfrmTestSimple.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
    GlobalOmniThreadPool.MonitorWith(OmniEventMonitor);
    GlobalOmniThreadPool.MaxExecuting := 20;
    GlobalOmniThreadPool.MaxQueued := 0;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>It works but if I increase the # of tasks (ie. TASKS_COUNT) to, say, 7000, I get an exception:</p>

<p><code>TOmniCommunicationEndpoint.Send: Queue is full</code></p>

<p>I read whatever I could find (OTL blog and forums, sample projects, googled a lot, etc...), it seems that to prevent this, I must empty the queue periodically.</p>

<p>So I tried this but it didn't work:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TfrmTestSimple.OmniEventMonitorTaskTerminated(const task: IOmniTaskControl);
begin
    Task.Terminate(1);       // I also tried: Task.Terminate(0);
    Task.Comm.Reader.Empty;  // Task.Comm.OtherEndpoint.Reader.Empty; didn't work either
    Task.Comm.Writer.Empty;  // Task.Comm.OtherEndpoint.Writer.Empty; didn't work either
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Any advice on how to empty the queue and avoid this exception?</p>

<p>I <strong>know</strong> that some may say that such a large number of tasks in queue is ridiculous, suffice to say it's neither a hypothetical question nor it's in the scope of my question to tell me to redesign my application, at this point I just need to know the limit of the queuing system in OTL and how to bypass this limitation.</p>

"3550896","<p>Unfortunately this is going to be a pretty open-ended question, but I am at my wit's ends and I thought I would reach out for some advice.  </p>

<p>This is a Visual C++ MFC app using Visual Studio 2008 SP1.</p>

<p>A coworker and I both had Office 2007 installed and we have both had strange DLL loading problems with our app since. Specifically, LoadLibrary is failing to load one our DLLs ( the first one it loads ) and returning error code 126 ( module not found ).  What's really strange is that if I just run the executable from the windows explorer it works fine. </p>

<p>I took the usual steps to diagnose the problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Verify that the file existed and that the current working directory was pointed at it.</li>
<li>Run dependency walker and verify that it's dependencies are loading correctly. They are all loading ok except the ones <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2465111/dependency-walker-reports-ieshims-dll-and-wer-dll-missing"">this question</a> says are ok to fail.</li>
<li>Experiment with loading some different DLLs at the same location in the code. Some of the simple 'stub' dlls succeed, but most of them fail.</li>
<li>Experiment with loading the DLLs that are failing from separate test apps - in an empty console app and a barebone MFC app, all the DLLs are loading fine!</li>
<li>Try to load the DLLs with LoadLibraryEx and the LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE flag, which does succeed but doesn't get us very far except to point out it's probably a dependency problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>I really don't know what else to do at this point. Like I said, Office 2007 is a common thread in our problem but I don't know what kind of problems it could create. I really don't know even what steps to take next. Any ideas?</p>

<p>edit: I'm pretty sure the current working directory is not in the DLL path for some reason. It seems the DLLs that are failing are ones that need any other DLLs. If I turn on Loader Snaps debug output the current working directory does not appear to be in the DLL loading path. Any idea what could cause this?</p>

<p>edit2: The current build dumped the executable into a directory other than the working directory. For some reason, when I tried to load a DLL which then tried to load ANOTHER DLL, the current working directory is no longer searched. By putting the executable into the directory with all of the DLLs I am trying to load, the problems go away. Based on all of this, and the output by loader snaps, I am 98% sure this is some bizarre Visual Studio bug and I will simply have to work around it.</p>

"36789215","<p>OK, so I have successfully set up my <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff951638%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Private Assembly</a> for my plugins of my executable, like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36644602/321013"">described here</a>: <sub>(This is just an example, my use case is technically the same, but not for plugins as such.)</sub></p>

<ul>
<li>Executable uses application manifest to declare <code>dependentAssembly</code> on <code>plugins</code> assembly</li>
<li><code>plugins</code> subdirectory contains <code>plugins.manifest</code></li>
<li><code>plugins.manifest</code> declares <code>assemblyIdentity</code> with <code>files</code> listing the plugin DLL(s) (say, <code>easyplug1.dll</code> and <code>xplug2.dll</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>What I don't quite get, and haven't yet found <em>any</em> direct explanation, is <strong>what about DLLs that the DLLs in the Private Assembly depend upon</strong>? Where should they be located, how are they found?</p>

<p>Example: The <code>xplug2.dll</code>, <em>which is 3rd party itself</em> needs the 3rd party dll <code>xbase.dll</code>. Naturally, xbase.dll is simply also deployed in the plugins directory. Is this enough? <strong>Does the Private Assembly need to list DLLs that are only used transitively by the (executable) module declaring its dependency on the <code>plugins</code> assembly?</strong> </p>

<hr>

<p>Partial answer so far <em>by trial and error</em>:</p>

<p>(A) It seems <em>all</em> DLLs, also those only used from other ""plugin"" DLLs must be listed in the Private Assembly manifest -- i.e. essentially one should list <em>all</em> DLL files in the <code>plugins</code> assembly directory.</p>

<p>(A.1) Any not-listed DLL <em>will not be found</em> in the directory, even if it's referenced from a DLL within the same subdirectory.</p>

<p>(A.2) I <em>assume</em> this to be due to all the DLL loading machinery using the (only) custom <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/2103032/321013"">Activation Context</a> from the executable, and if the DLL is not found there, <em>it seems to search from within the executable directory.</em></p>

<p>(A.3) I tried looking at the dependency chain with <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36049618/321013"">the latest version</a> of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_Walker"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dependency Walker</a> (2.2.10011), but it seems it can't handle this transitive scenario at all: Primary dependencies are are shown correctly, but transitive secondary dependencies are not resolved from the manifest, but relative to the base directory. (Seems it follows <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5778473/loadlibrary-from-another-dll"">plain <code>LoadLibrary</code> semantics</a> for <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2206270/plugin-dlls-that-depend-on-other-dlls"">the transient ones.</a>)</p>

<hr>

<p>File layout:</p>

<pre><code>...\base\app.exe 
    // - contains Application Manifest declaring dependency on `plugins`
    // - Loads xplug2.dll

...\base\plugins\xplug2.dll
    // - Loads xbase.dll (which is only used by xplug2.dll internally)

...\base\plugins\xbase.dll

...\base\plugins\plugins.manifest

<p>Pass image path through facial recognition, it will then save/serialize the results to disk and return back the image's index in the array (function: int AddImageToCollection)</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>I want to create a <code>.dat</code> file which provides better accuracy than the model I mentioned above.
It means better accuracy than this image.</p>

<h3>What I used.</h3>

<p>I basically used an example code of <code>train_shape_predictor_ex.cpp</code>.</p>

<p>And dataset I used is this -> 
Original: <a href=""http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/300-W/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/300-W/</a><br>
What I actually used: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/11znddaomgjfdw1/AAC9up5NOGTv2mc0dpYH6z4-a?dl=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/11znddaomgjfdw1/AAC9up5NOGTv2mc0dpYH6z4-a?dl=0</a> + iBug Data in <code>Image</code> directory.</p>

<p>My Directory was like this:</p>

<p><code>* name: /faces_iBug
* Image
  * I put all of the iBug images in this directory.
* 2008_002470.jpg

* training_with_face_landmarks.xml

<p>Then, I tried like,</p>

<p><code>$ ./train_shape_predictor_ex ~/faces_iBug
</code></p>

<hr>

<h3>What I tried.</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Put object bounding box with <code>imglab</code>.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Since the raw data installed from iBug doesn't have bounding box information, I put those information by using <code>imglab</code> which is a tool provided in Dlib.</li>
<li>I only wrote the bounding box and combined with annotation data to create the train data.</li>
<li>The data I created is in the directory I put on my Dropbox. The file name is <code>training_with_face_landmarks.xml</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Changing Parameters</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, I thought the failure is just because the parameters didn't fit to create the model.</li>
<li>Even I tried couple of parameter combinations, the problem didn't look like to be solved.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Applied same dataset for both train and test data (with only 11 images).</p>

<ul>
<li>This suceeded to create a right model. But I'm not sure why.</li>
<li>I actually used smaller dataset of only 11 images.</li>
<li>Though the acuracy is pretty bad, still it seems like the trainer could learn train data in a right way.</li>
<li>The result was like this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Applied same dataset for both train and test data (with all of the iBug images).</p>

<ul>
<li>Then I thought just applying same dataset for both train and test data might be the technique to create a model with Dlib.</li>
<li>But, it didn't actually work for this try as always.</li>

<p>As stated by dlib's creater @Davis King, on my jupyter notebook I executed :</p>

<p>Which verifies that my 'dlib' is using GPU through CUDA, and all other libraries depend on dlib like @adma ageitgey's 'face_recognition' will also use cuda acceleration.</p>

<p>So I was running a code for training images so that I can recognize faces in a video, using the code below:</p>

<p>This time it gave the coordinates of the location of the face in the image.</p>

<p>So this is happening again and again, for some images it just runs fine and for some, it gives one of the 2 errors(as stated above).</p>

<p>While using model='hog' it's running fine for all the similar images as used in model='cnn'.</p>

<p>So when I try to train the classifier on images in different folders using for loop:</p>

<pre><code>from face_recognition.face_detection_cli import image_files_in_folder
import os
import os.path
import face_recognition
for class_dir in os.listdir('./training images/'):
    count = 0
    for img_path in image_files_in_folder(os.path.join('./training images/', class_dir)):  
                count += 1
                image = face_recognition.load_image_file(img_path)
                face_bounding_boxes = face_recognition.face_locations(image,model='cnn')
                print(face_bounding_boxes, count)
</code></pre>

<p>It always stops after processing some images showing the same any of 2 errors(as stated above).
I tried every possible way to install dlib with GPU support, CUDA 9.0 toolkit and cuDNN 7.1.4. They all are working fine!</p>

<p>I don't know what's the real issue here, Is the memory (2 GB) of Graphic Card is less or something else.</p>

<p>Problem is that whenever I provide an image with transparency, GDLib consinders the transparency to be black, thus producing a wrong (much darker) output than is really the case.</p>

<p>For example this icon where the white area around the arrow is actually transparent:</p>

"9044612","<p>I've been working through many trial/error versions of an image loading/caching system. Being Delphi, I've always been comfortable with Object Oriented Programming. But since I've started implementing some multi-threading, I've been thinking that maybe this system should work on a procedural basis instead.</p>

<p>Why is because these processes will be kicked into a thread pool, do the dirty loading/saving of images, and free themselves up. I've been trying to wrap these threaded processes inside objects, when I could just use procedures/functions, records, events, and graphics. No need to wrap it all inside a class, when it's all inside a unit... right?</p>

<p>Now one main reason I'm asking is because this system is initialized at the bottom of the unit. When using the OmniThreadLibrary (OTL), it already has its own initialized thread pool, and I don't even need to initialize mine either.</p>

<p>So which approach is better for this system - wrapped inside an object, or just functions within the unit, and why? Any examples of multi-threading without wrapping anything inside an object, but in the unit instead?</p>

"2284649","<p>I'm making a programming learning game for my senior project and I'm looking for a compiler that can compile a DLL that can then be dynamically loaded into a Visual Studio 2008 C++ application.</p>

<p>The important idea here is that the compiler is redistributable. If VS was redistributable I'd be using that.</p>

<p>So far I'm had some success using MinGW, but that success is limited. Currently I'm only able to get one DLL loaded and working at a time. The moment I try to load a second one the VS C++ app crashes with a Access Violation error.</p>

<p>I've been able to load two DLLs compiled in VS itself without problem so it leads me to believe that it's something specific to MinGW, it's DLL's, and how they interact with LoadLibrary() and whatnot.</p>

<p>I've been working at this problem for quite some time and I'm frusterated. If anyone knows of a different compiler that you know would work instead of MinGW, or if you'd seen this problem perhaps you know why the second DLL crashes it. I'm sure it's related to each DLL stepping on the other in some way but I have no idea what that would be or how to find out.</p>

<p>It could be the way I'm compiling the DLL or how I'm loading it; I have no idea.</p>

"46719578","<p>I encountered an example using <code>rand()</code> from libc, via ctypes' <code>LoadLibrary</code>, where it allows faster random number generation than Python's <code>random.random</code> module.</p>

<p>I find it intriguing, since ctypes is in Python's standard library, and I am aware that every OS has some kind of ""libc"" C standard library module lying around. </p>

<p>However, I'm not very familiar with the C standard library or ctypes.</p>

<p>I was wondering if someone is perhaps using or is aware of specific libc functions, that work well using ctypes, and can boost python tasks with little risk or oddities.</p>

<pre><code>cd dlib-19.0/dlib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

<p>And the <code>-ldlib</code> option.</p>

<p>I can compile and execute the program, however the face detection is extremely slow. </p>

<p>I tried the same program on Windows with Visual Studio 2013. When I used the Debug Mode, the face detection was extremely slow as well, but was running pretty well in Release mode. So I thought, that the shared libraries might be in Debug mode as well and tried to force them in Release mode with these commands:</p>

<pre><code>cd examples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release 
sudo make install

<p>But the result was the same as before.</p>

<p>Does anybody have an Idea, what the reason could be, that it is that slow?</p>

To run it, I copy the correct .dll into the folder with bb_api.h and call <code>loadlibrary('bb_api','bb_api.h')</code>. While this works for the 32-bit version, when I use the 64-bit .dll in 64-bit Matlab, I get the following error:</p>

<p>So first everything works as it is supposed to, but after some minutes in ""getForegroundTask"" hwnd stays ""native@0x301aa"" (if eclipse is on foreground) but process becomes ""null"", result becomes ""0"" and task becomes an empty String.</p>

we use CentOS 5.4/G++ and VS2005 for development.</p>

<p>scenario:
we are currently working on an enhancement in our product and wanted to pass the new information back to the Java server code using JNI.
our C/C++ code works fine and we have tested it by running for around 6 hours or so in our dev environment. we have updated two result structure(which were already present) with one long value each to pass on the result of our new enhancement.</p>

<p>when we updated the JNI code to pass on the result to Java code, we found that Java server is crashing while loading JNI, we did debugging and found that JNI lib crashes, even, when we do not have our changes in JNI lib code base.</p>

<p>in our further debugging we found that, JNI Makefile includes a .c file(aa.c), which has a couple of our changes for the new enhancement; we started with commenting our changes in this aa.c file one by one and found that the crash happens only when we have BBB.cpp::method1()  call(which we have added, as part of our new enhancement).</p>

<p>The unusual part is, this .c file(aa.c) is not needed in the JNI lib and we do not have any methods of aa.c called from JNI lib;
Now we have removed aa.c from the JNI Makefile and compile just fine, but still crashes when we have BBB.cpp::method1() call, if we remove this method1() call then it works fine.</p>

<p>we are not sure, why/how it is linking to a file which is not included, in the Makefile and crashing.</p>

<p>this is the error log we see</p>

"13223383","<h1>Long story of what I'm trying to achieve</h1>

<p>I'm working on a program that dynamically loads DLLs as plugins.  I'm compiling the program using Microsoft Visual C++ 2008. Still, let's assume that any Visual C++ version with which Qt works should be supported. The program directory layout is following:</p>

<pre><code>| plugins/
|   plugin1.dll
|   plugin2.dll
| QtCore4.dll
| QtGui4.dll
| program.exe
</code></pre>

<p><code>program.exe</code> discovers all plugins DLL files, performs LoadLibrary() on them and calls a certain signature function to find out if it's actually a plugin or not. This works pretty well on computers which have vcredist for MSVC90 installed. Naturally, to make the program work on all computers I have to redistribute it with the msvc*.dll files and with the appropriate manifest file. Qt DLLs also require the redist to run.</p>

<p>Now, I've set up cmake to automatically copy over appropriate redist DLLs and manifest depending on the selected Visual Studio version. For the sake of simplicity let's keep assuming that I'm working with MSVC90. When the redist gets copied to the program directory the layout looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>| plugins/
|   plugin1.dll
|   plugin2.dll
| QtCore4.dll
| QtGui4.dll
| msvcm90.dll
| msvcp90.dll
| msvcr90.dll
| Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest (I'm also aware that this file is bugged in VS2008)
| program.exe
</code></pre>

<p><em>Regarding the bug in manifest file: <a href=""http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2008-September/023822.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2008-September/023822.html</a></em></p>

<h1>The problem</h1>

<p>The program with this layout now works on computers which do not have the redist installed, <strong>but</strong> the plugins are not getting loaded. In order to get the plugins to load I have to do one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Copy over the manifest file to <code>plugins/</code> directory. Remove all references to msvc*.dll files from the manifest file. This works but it's not nice because I'd have to support different versions of edited manifest files depending on the version of used MSVC. Also, I have no idea if this won't break with Visual Studio other than 2008.</li>
<li>Copy entire redist to <code>plugins/</code> directory. This doesn't require any modification to the manifest file, but now <code>program.exe</code> stupidly tries to load the msvc*.dll files thinking they are plugins. Naturally, this fails gracefully so no big harm is done. The other drawback is that the size of the program package grows by over 1 MB. Both these issues are something that I can live with, though.</li>
<li>Compile plugins with /MT switch. Brief testing has shown that this actually works but I'm not sure if it won't break anything in the future if both Qt and <code>program.exe</code> are /MD.</li>
</ol>

<h1>The question(s)</h1>

<p>What's the best solution? What's the correct solution? If there is more than one correct solution then which is the best practice? Am I the first person to ever try to do this?</p>

<h1>Update 1 (18 Nov. 2012)</h1>

<p>While the question remains unanswered I decided to go for the route that causes the least headache. Until now I've been using solution number 1 and I decided to stick with it. If CMake detects that user is using a different MSVC version than 2008 it will display a warning message saying that automatic packaging is not fully supported.</p>

<p>Both functions are <code>extern C</code>. PInvokeServer depends on PInvokeServer1 (using linker dependencies). PInvokeServer.dll and PInvokeServer1.dll are added to C# project with build action Content, so they are part of the application package. C# declarations:</p>

    const string dllName1 = @""Native\PInvokeServer1.dll"";

<p>Case 3, works:</p>

<p>Case 2: PInvoke is able to load PInvokeServer1.dll directly.</p>

<p>Case 3. Once PInvokeServer1.dll is loaded, PInvokeServer.dll can be loaded successfully as well.</p>

<p>Im my real program I have native C library depending on several other libraries. All these libraries are added to C# Store application package. But high-level library cannot be loaded, because PInvoke fails to load dependencies. The only way I can think about is to load low-level libraries using <code>LoadLibrary</code> PInvoke call, and finally use PInvoke call to high-level library. Is there better way?</p>

I read somewhere on Microsoft.com that the dll enters a ""lock"" when loaded as to prevent certain functions or code from being executed for security purposes. Is this feature blocking a message box from being displayed? Is there a work around such as elevated privileges, system, etc...? I am not sure if DEP has any effect either, I have it set to only protect critical Windows processes.</p>

<p>The calling process:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
int main()
{
    HMODULE hDll = LoadLibraryA(""dll.dll"");
    if (hDll == NULL)
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""Unable to load dll"";
    else
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Dll loaded @ "" &lt;&lt; hDll;
    FreeLibrary(hDll);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The dll file:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)
{
    switch (fdwReason)
    {
        case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
            MessageBox(NULL, ""Dll has been loaded."", ""Loaded"", MB_OK);
            break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think it might help me if I had a way to run the <code>.dll</code> though a debugger and see what <code>MessageBox()</code> returned, but I am not sure how to do that. Thanks!</p>

My company's proprietary algorithms are in a shared library compiled on a Linux 64 bit machine and I need to access them from my web service. I've created my JNI files with SWIG. The resultant java files are compiled and dropped in a jar. The jar is included in the EAR and seen by all projects in Eclipse. The resultant MODULE_wrap.cpp file  is compiled and included in my .so - call it libmylib.so</p>

<p>My web service, when it starts up, calls a static class to load my shared library via System.loadLibrary(""mylib""). There are no issues with this. My library is only loaded once and there are no exceptions. I've checked that the path to my library is in the java.library.path property - as expected since loadLibrary worked. </p>

<p>The resultant SWIG files work with a test driver outside of Eclipse - that is we can access native functions in the library. This makes me believe that the function names created by SWIG and the native mapping are being done correctly. However, when using Eclipse to create and deploy the web service EAR to JBOSS we get an UnsatisfiedLinkError complaining that a C++ constructor from my library cannot be found. </p>

"50349818","<p>I try to run a Python code for face detection using Dlib. But when I try to load the file <code>shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat</code> using the following command 
<code>face_detector =dlib.cnn_face_detection_model_v1('shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat')
</code>
I get the following error: </p>

ERROR: Error deserializing object of type unsigned long
   while deserializing object of type std::string
</code></pre>

<p>I have downloaded the shape predictor file from github: <a href=""https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models</a></p>

<p>This is my Python code </p>

<pre><code>import dlib
import cv2


face_detector = dlib.cnn_face_detection_model_v1('shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat')
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of the code is omitted because it's not necessary </p>

<p>I am using:
<code>Ubuntu 18.04</code> and <code>Python 3.6</code></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong> </p>

<p>If use the same file with the function <code>dlib.shape_predictor(shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat)</code> it runs without any problems! </p>

<p>It seems that there is a problem with the function <code>dlib.cnn_face_detection_model_v1</code>. Please correct me if I'm wrong!</p>

"39024165","<p>I am trying to train an object detector using D-lib. I selected close to 100 images for training. I am using the Python environment. As per documentation, I used the Imglab tool to draw the bounding boxes across the images. Every image is almost 4000*3000 pixels in size.
And then placed the generated XML file into my location and called the detector program. Here are my doubts and questions.</p>

<p>What should I use as the testing XML file while running the program?
I ran without assigning any testing XML in place. However, I get the following. Training with C: 5 Training with epsilon: 0.01 Training using 8 threads. Training with sliding window 81 pixels wide by 79 pixels tall. Training on both left and right flipped versions of images. Killed
What does 'killed' mean by the way?</p>

"46622227","<p>I built a Python Flask web API that involves machine learning and I've had a lot of frustration deploying it on Heroku. </p>

<p>The problem is, my app has a dependency on Dlib ( a library) and I can't seem to find a way to install in my Heroku server. I'm losing my mind trying to fix this and I can imagine other AI developers out there who might encounter this problem. Please help me</p>

<p><strong>Here is what I have done so far.</strong></p>

<p>I have tried not using a Buildpack by specifying dlib==19.4.0 along with its dependencies in my requirements.txt but It fails due to a dependency on Boost.</p>

<p>I have researched on the dependency for Dlib (<a href=""https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/</a>);</p>

<pre><code>build-essential cmake  # I already have this in my requirements.txt
libgtk-3-dev
libboost-all-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Also,</p>

<pre><code>numpy  # I already have this in my requirements.txt
scipy  # I already have this in my requirements.txt
sciKit-Image  # I already have this in my requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<p>So I included boost==0.1, cmake==0.7.1 &amp; boost-py==1.00 in my requirements.txt file.
The installation failed, here's the <strong>build log</strong></p>

  ThreadPool.MaxExecuting := 60;
  ThreadPool.MaxQueued := 0;
end;

<p>When i click on the button it creates 200 tasks fine, but while looking at the thread count from task manager, as soon as the threads starts decreasing if i click on button1 that moment then thread count suddenly drops to 0 and after that no matter how many times i click on button1 for scheduling tasks no thread is created and no function is performed. i actually encountered this error while sending data to server which schedule the tasks, i wasnt able to separate the server code areas so i just wrote a sample for generating the issue at user end. Can anyone help me on how to fix this issue?</p>

<p>This is the output with the second code, showing that the image generation is indeed functional and the problem is most likely the passing from sql to php:</p>

"31292729","<p>I wanted to realize a repetitive task in an OmniThreadLibrary worker task, that runs in another thread. The task should be executed every 3 seconds, for example.
Therefore I wrote a <code>TOmniWorker</code> descendant with an instance of <code>TTimer</code> as you can see below:</p>

<pre><code>program Project14;

{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}

{$R *.res}

uses
  System.SysUtils,
  Vcl.ExtCtrls,
  Vcl.Forms,
  OtlTaskControl;

type
  TMyTimerWorker = class(TOmniWorker)
  strict private
    FTimer: TTimer;
    procedure DoOnTimer(Sender: TObject);
  protected
    function Initialize: Boolean; override;
    procedure Cleanup; override;
  end;

{ TMyTimerWorker }

procedure TMyTimerWorker.Cleanup;
begin
  FTimer.Free;
  inherited;
end;

procedure TMyTimerWorker.DoOnTimer(Sender: TObject);
begin
  Beep;
end;

function TMyTimerWorker.Initialize: Boolean;
begin
  Result := inherited;
  if not Result then exit;

  FTimer := TTimer.Create(nil);
  FTimer.OnTimer  := DoOnTimer;
  FTimer.Interval := 3000;
  FTimer.Enabled  := True; // note: this isn't necessary, but is added to avoid hints that 'Enabled' might be 'False'
end;

var
  LTimerWorker: IOmniWorker;
begin
  try
    LTimerWorker := TMyTimerWorker.Create;
    CreateTask(LTimerWorker).Unobserved.Run;
    while True do
      Application.ProcessMessages;
  except
    on E: Exception do
      Writeln(E.ClassName, ': ', E.Message);
  end;
end.
</code></pre>

<p>I set breakpoints in <code>Initialize</code> and <code>DoOnTimer</code>. Former executes well but latter won't be called at all. BTW: <code>Cleanup</code> isn't called neither, so the task is still running.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Is it impossible to use a <code>TTimer</code> in an OTL task? If yes, why?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I found a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/8412753/4236400"">workaround</a> for <code>TTimer</code> () but why does <code>TTimer</code> approach not work?</p>

<p>It's easy enough to remove those directory names:</p>

<pre><code>    # this code works both in production and testing 
    files = conn.nlst(basedir)
    # proftd is weired it returns the basedir name too
    files = [f.split('/')[-1] for f in files]
</code></pre>

<p>but I would like to understand if this is something that pyftpdlib does wrong?<br>
Is this something that can be configured in <code>ProFTPD</code>?<br>
Is there something I need to know about the FTP protocol and NLST command?</p>

<h2>update</h2>

<p>I just tested another ftp server called <a href=""https://github.com/troglobit/uftpd/""><code>uftpd</code></a> it behaves like <code>pyftpdlib</code> when issuing <code>NLST</code>. </p>

"46928680","<p>I know there are other threads with this error, but it seems that the error has not 1 single solution and none of the other threads helped me in my case.</p>

<p>I am trying to process an image using <a href=""http://dlib.net/imaging.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dlib</a>. I have tried reading an image, accesing a pixel and saving an image with dlib, and it works. Code that works, for reference:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;dlib/gui_widgets.h&gt;
#include &lt;dlib/image_io.h&gt;
#include &lt;dlib/image_transforms.h&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;

using namespace std;
using namespace dlib;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    //reading the image
    array2d&lt;rgb_pixel&gt; img;
    load_image(img, ""landscape.bmp"");

    //accessing a pixel
    cout &lt;&lt; (int)img[0][0].red &lt;&lt; "","" &lt;&lt; (int)img[0][0].green &lt;&lt; "","" &lt;&lt; (int)img[0][0].blue &lt;&lt; endl;

    //saving an image
    string name = ""landscape2.bmp"";
    save_bmp(img, name);

    cout &lt;&lt; ""press enter to exit..."" &lt;&lt; endl;
    cin.ignore();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I have tried to create a function that takes an image and processes it. In order to process it I wanted to use some other functions that I defined in other modules. Here is the function from the same main.cpp file as the previous code:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""basic_preprocessing_alg.h""
#include &lt;vector&gt;

void    create_preprocessed_image(std::string image_name, int image_width = 1280, int image_height = 720, int elem_sim_constant = 1, int new_elem_sim_threshold = 10) {

    //reading the image and saving it to a dlib array named img
    array2d&lt;rgb_pixel&gt; img;
    load_image(img, ""landscape.bmp"");

    // sending the image to another function to be processed
    std::vector&lt;rgb_pixel&gt; frame = image_to_frame(img);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now I get the error. The 'img' in 'std::vector frame = image_to_frame(img);' is underlined and it says ""cannot be referenced -- it is a deleted function"".</p>

<p>The basic_preprocessing_alg.h file contains the folowing:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;dlib/gui_widgets.h&gt;
#include &lt;dlib/image_io.h&gt;
#include &lt;dlib/image_transforms.h&gt;

std::vector&lt;dlib::rgb_pixel&gt; image_to_frame(dlib::array2d&lt;dlib::rgb_pixel&gt; frame);
</code></pre>

<p>And the basic_preprocessing_alg.cpp contains the following:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""basic_preprocessing_alg.h""
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;dlib/gui_widgets.h&gt;
#include &lt;dlib/image_io.h&gt;
#include &lt;dlib/image_transforms.h&gt;


std::vector&lt;dlib::rgb_pixel&gt; image_to_frame(dlib::array2d&lt;dlib::rgb_pixel&gt; frame) {
    //for now it only returns an empty vector, just for testing
    return std::vector&lt;dlib::rgb_pixel&gt;();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have to mention that I am a C++ beginner, I have coded in Python mostly and just recently tried C++. It might be a rookie mistake or something, but I am utterly confused and I could not find anything useful on Google.</p>

<p>The entire error message I get when I try to build:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt;c:\users\...\main.cpp(51): error C2280: 'dlib::array2d&lt;dlib::rgb_pixel,dlib::default_memory_manager&gt;::array2d(const dlib::array2d&lt;dlib::rgb_pixel,dlib::default_memory_manager&gt; &amp;)': attempting to reference a deleted function

</code></pre>

<p>I don't understand what is the function that I attempt to reference which was deleted. I don't see how to fix this or what is wrong with my code.</p>

<p><em>I just found that way:</em> </p>

<p>Define a color and set it to transparent.</p>

imagesavealpha($img, false);       // false = single color transparency

$mask_color = imagecolorallocatealpha($img, 0, 255, 0, 127);
imagecolortransparent( $img, $mask_color );

<p>But the result is a single color transparency. If i try to merge it with an image with alpha channel, the mask color gets visible again. </p>

<p>This happens at the moment i enable imagesavealpha() again, needed for that merge prozess.</p>

<p>By the way: I create the <em>$img</em> by merging a source image with an mask image.</p>

<pre><code>$new_img = imagecreatetruecolor( 150, 100 );
$new_white = imagecolorallocatealpha( $new_img, 255, 255, 255, 0 );
imagefill( $new_img, 0, 0, $new_white );

imagealphablending($new_img, false);   // has to be false for full alpha
imagesavealpha($new_img, true);       // true = full alpha channel

<p>etc.</p>

<p><strong>Second aproach:</strong><br>
Making library out of it  </p>

<pre><code>all: dlib.a

CXXFLAGS = -Wall -g -std=c++11 -pthread -DLIB_NO_GUI_SUPPORT

dlib.o : control.h
    g++ $(CXXFLAGS) -c $^ -o $@ 

dlib.a: dlib.o
    ar -rv $@ $^
</code></pre>

<p>But since everything is header in dlib then what header should I include ? None... since official page forbids from adding it to compiler's include path. Then this approach still doesn't work... just for info - compile artifacts take over 60 mb.</p>

<p><strong>Third approach</strong><br>
Adding the folder that contains the dlib folder to include search path and then use include statements of the form #include  (dlib official statement). </p>

<pre><code>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/linaro/Quadrocopter/dlib
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
</code></pre>

<p>Also</p>

<pre><code>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/linaro/Quadrocopter/
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
</code></pre>

<p>First gives: </p>

<pre><code>/home/linaro/Quadrocopter/dlib/dlib_include_path_tutorial.txt:1:2: error: #error ""Don't put the dlib folder in your include path""
</code></pre>

<p>etc.<br>
Second has similar effect as First Approach</p>

<p>I've also created test build with only 2 compilation artifacts:</p>

<pre><code>all : test
CXXFLAGS = -g -O3 -std=c++11
LFLAGS = -lpthread -lnsl 

OBJS = maintest.o LogWriter.o
HDRS = LogWriter.h Constants.h

$(OBJS) : $(HDRS)

test : $(OBJS) 
    g++ -pthread -Idlib/control.h $^ -o $@
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone please help me with this ? (and no -Ldlib is also not working)</p>

"388201","<p>I'm not sure if memory is the culprit here.  I am trying to instantiate a GD image from data in memory (it previously came from a database).  I try a call like this:</p>

<pre><code>my $image = GD::Image-&gt;new($image_data);
</code></pre>

<p><code>$image</code> comes back as <code>undef</code>.  The POD for GD says that the constructor will return <code>undef</code> for cases of insufficient memory, so that's why I suspect memory.</p>

<p>The image data is in PNG format.  The same thing happens if I call newFromPngData.</p>

<p>This works for very small images, like under 30K.  However, slightly larger images, like ~70K will cause the problem.  I wouldn't think that a 70K image should cause these problems, even after it is deflated.</p>

<p>This script is running under CGI through Apache 2.0, on OS 10.4, if that matters at all.</p>

<p>Are there any memory limitations imposed by Apache by default?  Can they be increased?</p>

<p>Thanks for any insight!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> For clarification, the GD::Image object never gets created, so clearing out the <code>$image_data</code> from memory isn't really an option.</p>

<pre><code>TMethod = procedure of object;

TThreadExecuter = class;

IPresentationAnimation = interface
  ['{57DB6925-5A8B-4B2B-9CDD-0D45AA645592}']
  procedure IsBusy();
  procedure IsAvaliable();
end;

procedure TThreadExecuter.Execute(AMethod: TMethod); overload;
var ATask : IOmniTaskControl;
begin
  ATask := CreateTask(
    procedure(const ATask : IOmniTask) begin AMethod(); end
  ).OnTerminated(
    procedure begin ATask := nil; end
  ).Unobserved().Run();

  while Assigned(ATask) do
    begin
      Sleep(10);
      Application.ProcessMessages;
    end;
end;

procedure TThreadExecuter.Execute(ASender: TCustomForm; AMethod: TMethod); overload;
var AAnimator : IPresentationAnimation;
begin
  if(Assigned(ASender)) then
    begin
      TInterfaceConsolidation.Implements(ASender, IPresentationAnimation, AAnimator, False);
      if(Assigned(AAnimator)) then AAnimator.IsBusy()
      else ASender.Enabled := False;
    end;
  try
    Self.Execute(AMethod);
  finally
    if(Assigned(ASender)) then
      begin
        if(Assigned(AAnimator)) then AAnimator.IsAvaliable()
        else ASender.Enabled := True;
      end;
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>so before i start executing i block the interface like this:</p>

<pre><code>TMyForm = class(TForm, IPresentationAnimation);

procedure TMyForm.LoadData();
begin
  TThreadExecuter.Execute(Self, Self.List);
end;

procedure TMyForm.IsBusy();
begin
  try
    Self.FWorker := TPresentationFormWorker.Create(Self);
    Self.FWorker.Parent := Self;
    Self.FWorker.Show();
  finally
    Self.Enabled := False;
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>and when the thread finish i release the block like this:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TMyForm.IsAvaliable();
begin
  try
    Self.FWorker.Release();
  finally
    Self.Enabled := True;
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>note: TPresentationFormWorker is a animated form that i put in form of the busy one.</p>

<p>the problem is that when the form is ""busy"" executing the thread even after i disable it, i can still interact with him, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>i can click in any button and when the thread finish the execution the action of the button are triggered;</li>
<li>i can typing in any control, e.g a Edit some nonsense information and when the thread finish the execution the content i provided to the control are erased back to before (ui rollback? lol);</li>
</ul>

<p>so my guess is that while the thread are working thanks to the application.processmessages the interaction i made to the disable form are sended to the queue and once the thread finish they are all send back to the form.</p>

<p>my question is: is possible to actually disable the form, when i say disable i mean block all messages until certain point that i manually allow that can start accept again?</p>

<p>thx in advance.</p>

I am using opencv to crop the areas detected using dlib landmarking points detector. 
However, the cropped images are blue in colour. Any idea on why the change?
And also I am finding some of the images are skipping this code. So, for example if I have 20 images in my source folder, after running them through the dlib detector, I should be getting 40 resultant images int he destination folder as I am extracting two images from every input.

<p>Switching to the generic instructions it says follow the advice in the INSTALL file; which says: ""cd to the directory containing the package's source code and type ./configure to configure the package for your system."" Which flat does not work: I've cd'ed into every directory of the tarball and running that command does nothing.</p>

<p>So, trying to install twiki required me to install perl, which required me to install the perl modules: FreezeThaw, CGI, Error, HTML, Time-modules, and GD -- which itself required me to install gdlib -- which further suggested I install zlib, libpng, FreeType 2.x, JPEG library, and XPM. And of course, I'm stuck at the installing gdlib stage.</p>

<p><strong>My question is</strong>: what other process can possibly demean humanity to such a level? I cannot fathom the depths of cruelty that lay ahead of me as I dive ever deeper into this misery onion. Should I just end it all? Can meaning be brought from this madness? Will the sun come up tomorrow, and if so, does it even matter? </p>

<p>But seriously, any suggestions on what to do differently/better would be much appreciated -- I can't remember what a child's laughter sounds like anymore. </p>

<pre><code>// Thread 1
struct foo {
    int (*DoSomething)(void ** parm);
};

HMODULE fooHandle = LoadLibrary(""pathToFoo"");
typedef int (*loadUpFooFP)(foo ** fooPtrPtr);
loadUpFooFP loadUpFoo;
loadUpFoo = (loadUpFooFP)GetProcAddress(fooHandle, ""fooLoader"");
foo * myFoo;
loadUpFoo(&amp;myFoo);
</code></pre>

<p>This all works great and I can then call</p>

<pre><code>myFoo-&gt;DoSomething(&amp;parmPtr);
</code></pre>

<p>This works, too! Now, another thread comes along and loads up its foo:</p>

<pre><code>// Thread 2
foo * myFooInThread2;
loadUpFoo(&amp;myFooInThread2);
</code></pre>

<p>And this, too, works great. In thread 2 I can call DoSomething:</p>

<pre><code>// Thread 2
myFooInThread2-&gt;DoSomething(&amp;anotherParmPtr);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when thread 1 eventually goes away, I have a problem. I notice that debugging in Visual Studio that the address of DoSomething can no longer be evaluated. After the first thread dies, when I call:</p>

<pre><code>myFooInThread2-&gt;DoSomething(&amp;anotherParmPtr);
</code></pre>

<p>I get an access violation. The myFooInThread2 pointer is still valid, but the function pointer was not. This function pointer was set by a call into loadUpFoo which in turn was in a dll loaded by LoadLibrary.</p>

<p>My question is: where do I start looking for the reason this is failing? Is it some problem with the way the external DLL (that I load with LoadLibrary) is setting the function pointer in my foo struct? Or is it something to do with differing threads using the same library? Or, could it somehow be related to my usage of COM in this application (would calling CoUninitialize in the first thread somehow free this memory or library)?</p>

<p>I can provide more details on the COM setup if that looks like it could be responsible. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> Thanks for the suggestions so far. The foo struct is opaque - I don't really know much about its implementation. The foo struct is declared in a header I import. There are no reference counting methods that I explicitly call and there are no other interactions with the library that's loaded with LoadLibrary. I'm pretty sure the foo struct is not memory mapped to some COM class, but like I said it's opaque and I can't say for sure.</p>

<p>The foo pointers' lifetimes are properly managed (not deleted).</p>

<p>The foo structure is an encryption library, so I'm not at liberty to divulge any more. At this point, I'm confident that there is nothing inherently wrong with my usage of LoadLibrary across different threads and within a COM application (and I suppose that the function pointer memory cleanup is being caused by something in the library itself outside of my control).</p>

<pre><code>struct mmod_rect
{
    mmod_rect() = default; 
    mmod_rect(const rectangle&amp; r) : rect(r) {}
    mmod_rect(const rectangle&amp; r, double score) : rect(r),detection_confidence(score) {}
    mmod_rect(const rectangle&amp; r, double score, const std::string&amp; label) : rect(r),detection_confidence(score), label(label) {}

    rectangle rect;
    double detection_confidence = 0;
    bool ignore = false;
    std::string label;

    operator rectangle() const { return rect; }
    bool operator == (const mmod_rect&amp; rhs) const
    { 
        return rect == rhs.rect 
               &amp;&amp; detection_confidence == rhs.detection_confidence
               &amp;&amp; ignore == rhs.ignore 
               &amp;&amp; label == rhs.label;
    }
};

inline mmod_rect ignored_mmod_rect(const rectangle&amp; r)
{
    mmod_rect temp(r);
    temp.ignore = true;
    return temp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If it is relevant, the documentation for rectangles is found <a href=""http://dlib.net/dlib/geometry/rectangle.h.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  Basically, rectangle is a class that is initialized by passing in integers for left, top, right, and bottom.</p>

<p>The working code I was provided with first defines a vector of mmod_rects as follows:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;mmod_rect&gt; rects;
</code></pre>

<p>Then it pushes to the vector with the line:</p>

<pre><code>rects.push_back(rectangle(left, top, right, bottom));
</code></pre>

<p>I am confused by the above line.  Since rects is a vector of mmod_rects and NOT a vector of rects, how is it that the code gets away with calling the constructor for a rect and pushing it on to the vector.  Why doesn't this throw a compiler error?  I assume it has to do with the line in mmod_rect's struct definition, where it says:</p>

<pre><code>mmod_rect(const rectangle&amp; r) : rect(r) {}
</code></pre>

<p>My understanding is that this means that you can construct an mmod_rect by passing in a reference to a rectangle.  I am just confused by the syntax using the colon </p>

<pre><code> : rect(r) {}
</code></pre>

<p>If someone could explain what exactly this syntax does, and how the push_back operation here works, that'd be great.</p>

<p>Now on to the main thing I want to ask.  My goal is to populate the vector rects with mmod_rects that have their ignore flag set to 1.  How would I go about doing this?  Would the following code accomplish the goal?</p>

<pre><code>mmod_rect r(rectangle(left, top, right, bottom));
r.ignore = 1;
rects.push_back(r);
</code></pre>

<p>is there a better way to do this using ignored_mmod_rect?  I don't fully understand what the code does.  </p>

<p>First, I have a simple DLL built from the code</p>

<pre><code>#using ""mscorlib.dll""

#include ""windows.h""

__declspec(dllexport)
void sayHello()
{
    OutputDebugStringA( ""Hello from managed code!"" );
}
</code></pre>

<p>I compile this on the commandline to a DLL using</p>

<pre><code>cl /CLR /LD dllcode.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I have a simple program consisting of nothing more than</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
int main()
{
    HINSTANCE lib = LoadLibrary( ""dllcode.dll"" );
    if ( !lib ) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I build an application out of this using</p>

<pre><code>cl loader.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>So I end up with <code>dllcode.dll</code> and <code>loader.exe</code> in the same directory. When trying to run <code>loader.exe</code>, I always get return code '1'. Looking up the error code yielded by <code>GetLastError()</code> shows that loading <code>dllcode.dll</code> failed due to <code>The specified module could not be found.</code></p>

<p>Does anybody know why this could be? Does it have something to do with manifests which need to be embedded into <code>dllcode.dll</code> or so? I ran the depends program on dllcode.dll but it didn't yield any problems as far as I could tell.</p>

"40832984","<p>I am trying to find the start + end time of a person appears in a video.
My current approach is to find the person using face detection, and then track his face using dlib object tracking (i.e. if the person is turning around in the video, i can't know that he is still in the video using face recognition. Therefore i need both detection and tracking techniques).</p>

<p>The problem is that the object tracking still tracks after an object, even if there was a camera shot cut or scene changed.</p>

<p>So, I tried to initialize the tracking object every shot. But, it's not so easy to detect the shots. even with very high sensitivity, ffmpeg and <a href=""http://mklab.iti.gr/project/video-shot-segm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://mklab.iti.gr/project/video-shot-segm</a> don't return all of the shot cuts.</p>

<p>So, it turns out that I need to compare the object rectangle of the previous frame, with the rectangle detected in the current frame.</p>

<p>Any idea of a function that can give me a ""similarity score"" between two rectangles in two frames?</p>

"55552416","<p>The official example from telegram explains that in order to use <code>getChats()</code> command, one needs to set two parameters '<code>offset_order</code>' and '<code>offset_chat_id</code>'.
I'm using this <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/tglib"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">node.js wrapper for the TDLib</a>.
So when I use <code>getChats()</code> with the following params:</p>

<pre><code>'offset_order': '9223372036854775807',
'offset_chat_id': 0,
'limit': 100

<p>just like it is explained in the <a href=""https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/docs/classtd_1_1td__api_1_1get_chats.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, to get a list of chats from the beginning, the
  offset_order should be equal to 2^63 - 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as a result I get 100 chats from the top of the user's list.</p>

<p>What I can't understand is how do I iterate through that list? How do I use the API pagination?</p>

<p>When I try to enter a legitimate chat_id from the middle of the first 100, I still get the same first 100, so it seems like it makes no difference.</p>

<p>If I change that offset_order to ANY other number, I get an empty list of chats in return...</p>

"40699842","<p>In the paper ""<a href=""http://cv.snu.ac.kr/research/VDSR/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Accurate Image Super-Resolution Using Very Deep Convolutional Networks</a>"", they define loss function as encludien distance of <code>[high resolution image - low resolution image] == [true residual]</code> and <code>[network output] == [predict residual]</code>. The purpose of the loss function is minimize the loss between true residual and predicted residual.</p>

<p>More precisely, the objective is minimize <code>((r-f(x))^2)/2</code>
r is the true residual, f(x) is the predict residual.</p>

<p>Following is the implementation of the loss function</p>

<pre><code>double compute_loss_value_and_gradient (

    double loss = 0;
    output_label_type update_gradient(grad.nr(), grad.nc());
    update_gradient = 0;
    for(long i = 0; i != output_tensor.num_samples(); ++i){
        auto const predict_residual = image_plane(output_tensor, i);
        DLIB_CASSERT(predict_residual.nr() == truth-&gt;nr() &amp;&amp;

        //I set the label(truth) as
        //[high_res_img - low_res_img] == [truth residual_img].
        auto const error_residual = *truth - predict_residual;
        auto const eu_dist = sum(pointwise_multiply(error_residual, error_residual));
        //after derivative, gradient of euclidean distance are
        //input - reference, since output_tensor is a mini batch
        //I sum all of them together
        update_gradient += error_residual;
        loss += eu_dist;
        ++truth;
    }

    return loss / 2.0 / output_tensor.num_samples();
}
</code></pre>

<p>However this loss function do not work well(loss stuck around 8.88~8.9 and do not seem to converge), I guess it is because gradient update has bug. </p>

<p>If you need whole source codes, I put it at <a href=""http://pastebin.com/GyRTPLjy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pastebin</a>. Network architecture is</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename SUBNET&gt;
using con_net = relu&lt;bn_con&lt;con&lt;64,3,3,1,1, SUBNET&gt;&gt;&gt;;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>The paper implement the network by 20 convolution layers and use gradient clip to avoid the problem of gradient explosion/vanishing, instead I use 5 convolution network for experiment purpose and prefer batch normalization to avoid gradient explosion/vanishing.</p>

<p>params of trainer and optimizer</p>

<pre><code>    dnn_trainer&lt;vsdr::net_00, adam&gt; trainer(net, adam(0.0001, 0.9, 0.999));
    trainer.set_learning_rate(0.001);
    trainer.set_min_learning_rate(1e-7);
    trainer.set_mini_batch_size(128);
</code></pre>

<p>Edit 0: function <code>to_label</code> never called when training.</p>

<p>Edit 1: I do not apply sqrt on the distance, because this could simplify the derivative</p>

<p>Edit 2 : Found the problem of euclidean lost, the way I update gradient is wrong.</p>

<pre><code>double compute_loss_value_and_gradient (

        return loss / 2.0 / output_tensor.num_samples() / output_tensor.nc()/ output_tensor.nr();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Another problem is the network architecture, it should not add relu on top of the last conv layer.</p>

<pre><code>using net_00 = loss_euclidean_dist&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;;

<p>Now the training process looks much better, but the predicted residual is bad, psnr of the enlarge even worse than bicubic. I try to remove batch normalization and use very low learning rate(1e-5) to avoid gradient explosion, but this cannot work either. </p>

redis = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0, password='')

</code></pre>

<p>Leads to </p>

<pre><code>Segmentation Fault (core dumped)
</code></pre>

<p>loads and dumps are chosen to pickle and unpickle a custom class object (dlib.HOG_detector) to the redis memory. Have also tried using the 'dill' library with no luck.</p>

<p>What is perplexing is the fact that this runs without any error on my local machine (OS X), however the same run on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with Python 2.7.12 results in the aforementioned. </p>

<p>The only other difference between the operating systems that I haven't included above is the fact that I run the code in a virtualenv on my local machine. However I believe this should not directly or indirectly cause this error.</p>

<p>Looking for any pointers or suggestions that would point me in the right direction. Thanks !</p>

<p>Edit : Per the suggestion by Davis, I tried to pickle the object using version 2 of the pickle format. Post this I run into the below mentioned error when trying to loads from the pickle module, something I am still unable to resolve.</p>

"12405365","<p>I have 2 arrays that are combined into one. One array with some products and the other array with numbers (number of products).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>So far so good. What I want is to shuffle this array in such way that I will get a row with first 2 x RT542 then 1 x RT538 then 3x RT543 and so forth and so on, up to the max number of items.</p>

<p>I am using this:</p>

        $random = array();

        foreach ($keys as $key) {

            $random[$key] = $myBricksAndRatios[$key]; 

            for($i = 1; $i &lt;= $myBricksAndRatios[$key]; $i++) {
                $cur = imagecreatefrompng(""/var/www/brickmixer/bricks/"". $key.""-$i.png"");

<p>It do shuffle but it creates a row of images of the same products, not in random order.
I need to preserve the maximum number of products to each product key. </p>

<p>SOLUTION:</p>

<pre><code>function shuffle_bricks($array) {

"37033470","<p>I'm using a vendor's C API for a piece of business software by loading their library using Python's ctypes module.</p>

<p>After deploying the software I wrote, I found that the vendor's library leaks memory on a consistent and predictable basis, according to the number of calls of a certain function that's part of their API.</p>

<p>I even duplicated the leak in a C program that uses no heap allocations.</p>

<p>I contacted the vendor about the issue, and they said they're working on it, but I probably can't realistically expect a fix until the next version of the software.</p>

<p>I had the idea of reloading the vendor's dll after a certain threshold of calls to the leaking function, but this did not release the leaked memory.</p>

<p>I found that I could force the library to unload like so:</p>

<pre><code>_ctypes.FreeLibrary(vendor_dll._handle)
</code></pre>

<p>This frees the memory, but causes the interpreter to crash seemingly randomly after a number of minutes of using the vendor's API.</p>

<p>I found this issue in the Python bug tracker that describes my situation:
<a href=""https://bugs.python.org/issue14597"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.python.org/issue14597</a></p>

<p>It seems that if there's still an open reference to the library, forcing it to unload will inevitably crash the Python interpreter.</p>

<p>Worst case scenario, I'm thinking I could load the vendor's library in a separate process, proxy requests using a multiprocessing Queue, and setup a watchdog to recreate the process if the interpreter dies.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to work around this? </p>

"42309304","<p>I've been reading about resizing images on the fly using some php scripts with URL rewriting (/img/500x500/image-name.jpg), but a lot of people say it's a bad practice as it's a RAM and CPU consuming (1Mb image uses about 3Mb of RAM). So I thought I would just generate these images once and then save them in a cache folder, that way I can keep the original img and also the resized ones in this folder.</p>

<p>I'm currently saving 3 different sizes in the server when the image is being uploaded (100x100, 200x200, 500x500). Few time ago I used to display some images in 500x500, but now I have changed a little bit the design to display these images in only 300x300, So I'm now stuck with large images which could slow a little bit the page load!</p>

<p>So what I'm thinking to do is to save the original image (1500x1500), and when it's being viewed for the first time, i'll generate the appropriate thumbnails and save them in a folder on the server. That way, if I ever change the design again, I can simply delete the image cache folder to create the new thumbnails with the new sizes...</p>

<p>I still don't have any codes as the website is still being developed and I'm just trying to anticipate these facts. it's an ecommerce website</p>

<p>Do you think this is a wise way to deal with images??</p>

"30779068","<p>So my application is a taxi call dispatch system, in which an operator receives calls over the phone and assigns received calls to a driver. On the Call Details form where the call detail is entered, as soon as the Save button is clicked, the form should close, should send an email to the taxi cab driver in a background thread, and the main form is shown, where he can select the next call and assign it to another driver. </p>

<p>The hard bit about the design is that it should be a queue, meaning an email in the queue needs to wait until processing for an email that is being sent has completed. Of course the email sending is happening in a different thread than the main VCL thread.</p>

<p>There only response back to the main thread would be the number of emails remaining to be sent in the queue, via a function call from the main thread to the emailer thread. Eg. if the user tries to close the application, it will ask the emailer queue class if there are any emails pending in the queue.</p>

<p>In Delphi, what class design and constructs will best implement this functionality? I'm sure it has one or more TThreads, but I'm lost beyond that. I could have started writing something, but I'm sure it would have been wrong, and I would need to tear it apart, post here and start again based on recommendations. That is why I posted here first - I want design tips. Since I'm using Delphi, I posted here because I want Delphi-specific design tips. Thanks in advance for any answers.</p>

<p>Note: I'm open to using either a TThread implementation or OmniThreadLibrary.</p>

"27733581","<p>So I am injecting a DLL into a program. I can verify that the DLL is injected with help from Process Explorer. After the injection I am looping all modules from the process, comparing the names and return the injected dll as a HMODULE.</p>

<p>Then I GetProcAddress() this HMODULE to find a extern function inside of it, but for some reason this does not work properly.</p>

<p>When I breakpoint and check dllAddress it says:</p>

<p>When I use LoadLibrary to load the DLL in my current program and use that as a HMODULE, it does work.</p>

"46152275","<p>Hi I'm trying to implement dlib facial landmark detection in android. I know, but I need as many fps I can get. There are 2 issues that I face,</p>

<ul>
<li>Conversion Chain</li>
<li>Resizing</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, I am getting the data from a <code>preview callback</code> set to a <code>camera</code>. It outputs a <code>byte[]</code> of a <strong>NV21</strong> Image. Since dlib dont know <code>image</code> and only know <code>array2d&lt;dlib::rgb_pixel&gt;</code>, I need to conform the data to it. The implementation that I get uses bitmap, and when I try to use there code, I have a chain of conversion <code>byte[]-&gt;bmp-&gt;array2d</code>, I want to implement a <code>byte[]-&gt;array2d</code> conversion.</p>

<p>Now, I need to leverage the performance of dlib by manipulating the size of the image fed in to it. My use-case though doesn't involve small faces so I can down-scale the input image to boost performance, but lets say I am successful on making the <code>byte[]-&gt;array2d</code> conversion, how can I resize the image? Resizing in bitmap though have many fast implementations but I need to cut the bitmap involvement to extract more fps. I have an option on resizing the <code>byte[]</code> or the converted one <code>array2d</code>, but again... how? Im guessing its good to do the resizing after the conversion because it will now be operating on native and not on java.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>The down-scaling should take the <code>byte[]</code>(not the <code>dlib::arrray2d</code>) form as input since I need to do something on the down-scaled <code>byte[]</code>.</p>

<p>So my final problem is to implement this on jni</p>

<pre><code>byte[] resize(ByteArray img, Size targetSize);
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>dlib::array2d&lt;rgb_pixel&gt; convert(ByteArray img);

But what I understand from the documentation is that the similar <code>svm_c_linear_dcd_trainer</code> has the option to 'warm-start', which sounds like a better thing to do than 'cold-start', e.g., inside a cross-validation loop. However, <code>svm_c_linear_dcd_trainer</code> is the selected method for a different type of problem, the main difference being application to unlabelled data. </p>

<p>Would there be a problem in using <code>svm_c_linear_dcd_trainer</code> on labelled data, or is there another good reason why <code>svm_c_linear_trainer</code> is better?</p>

<a href=""https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/face_recognition/api.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/face_recognition/api.py</a></p>

<p>C++ code:</p>

<pre><code>    frontal_face_detector detector;
    ...
        for (auto face : detector(img, numberOfTimesToUpsample))
        {
            auto shape = sp(img, face); //sp = shape_predictor 5 face landmarks same as python lib
            matrix&lt;rgb_pixel&gt; face_chip;
            extract_image_chip(img, get_face_chip_details(shape,150,0.25), face_chip); // Chip size and padding same as dlib python settings
            faces.push_back(move(face_chip));
            coords.push_back(face);
        }
    ...
        std::vector&lt;dlib::matrix&lt;float,0,1&gt;&gt; face_descriptors = net(faces, 16); // net is dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1 same as python lib
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>The python library upsamples once by default, and uses the small (5 point) shape predictor,</p>

<p>so I invoke the c++ code with <code>numberOfTimesToUpsample</code> as 1, and as my c++ code doesn't do the jittering, then I invoke the python code as:
<code>encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(image, num_jitters=0)[0]
</code></p>

<p>However, when I run an image with a face through both systems, the encodings come out quite different. For example, the c++ output of the first few dims:</p>

<pre><code>-0.131519
0.0520326
0.0556113
-0.101895
-0.165266
</code></pre>

<p>And the python:</p>

<pre><code>-0.14469159
0.04349349
0.03403644
-0.1062524
-0.18296713
</code></pre>

<p>I've examined the dlib C++-Python API for computing encodings here: <a href=""https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/tools/python/src/face_recognition.cpp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/tools/python/src/face_recognition.cpp</a> and cannot really see any major differences other than not casting everything to <code>double</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I've tried converting to double as well. All the numbers are just the same.</p>

<p>I've tried building my project linked to the .so file that the python dlib library comes with. Still got the same numbers.</p>

<p>I checked that my method of reading in the image data produces the same RGB pixel values as the python PIL.Image reading-into-numpy-array does. Everything looks fine there.</p>

<p>I'd like to reliably be able to produce the same output.
What am I missing? </p>

"8581030","<p>I have a program which stores plugins in multiple directories, like so:</p>

<pre><code>root/
  core/bin/
    app.exe
    core.dll
    plugin.dll
    support.dll
  a/bin/
    a.dll
    a_support.dll
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, <code>a.dll</code> imports <code>core.dll</code>, <code>support.dll</code>, and <code>a_support.dll</code> (they are in that order in the import table). <code>a_support.dll</code> imports <code>support.dll</code>. I can change all but the support modules, those are redists of a third-party library.</p>

<p>My code calls <code>LoadLibraryEx(name, NULL, LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH)</code> to load each plugin. For <code>core.dll</code> and <code>plugin.dll</code>, this works fine. </p>

<p>When I try to load <code>a.dll</code>, it fails <em>saying <code>a_support.dll</code> was not found</em>. No errors about <code>core.dll</code> or <code>support.dll</code>, perhaps because they're already in memory. </p>

<p>My suspicion is that when <code>a_support.dll</code> is loaded, <code>support.dll</code> cannot be found, but this seems unusual as <code>a.dll</code> appears to import <code>support.dll</code> before <code>a_support.dll</code>.</p>

<p>Is this layout of modules <em>even possible</em> to use? Will the system be able to use the already-loaded support DLLs, or will it go searching for them and fail? Would there be a way to handle this through manifests? Is there a way to make this work, or will I have to relocate all modules into a single directory?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> At Adrian McCarthy's suggestion, I ran the loading sequence with Process Monitor tracking, and it seems that when I call <code>LoadLibrary(""root/a/bin/a.dll"", ...)</code>, it starts by searching the root directory, then system directories, then down through the path. For some reason, it never searches <code>a/bin/</code>, which it very much should.</p>

<p>I double-checked the paths, and noticed that my calls to load <code>plugin.dll</code> where using the wrong path (root, instead of root/core/bin). Either way, <code>core.dll</code> was loading correctly. After fixing that, I tried it again and this time <code>a.dll</code> does find <code>a_support.dll</code> and seems to load. However, that makes absolutely no sense, unless the loader is successfully using <code>support.dll</code> from... somewhere. The procmon log doesn't show it even attempting to load <code>support.dll</code> again, so I'm not entirely sure at this point if there actually is a problem (besides behavior from the loader that makes no sense).</p>

<p>All the related files, like <code>XmbTextExtents</code> are in <code>/opt/X11/share/man/man3</code>  and the zipped versions (<code>XmbTextExtents.3.gz</code>) are here <code>/opt/local/share/man/man3</code>. </p>

<p>The error raises from the fact that the dlib installation looks at <code>/anaconda/include/X11/</code> while it should look at <code>/opt/X11/include/X11</code> (I guess). I have tried to edit the relevant KEYS in the <code>CMakeCache.txt</code> file so they look as:</p>

<pre><code>x11_path:FILEPATH=/opt/X11/include

//Path to a file.
xlib_path:PATH=/opt/X11/include/X11
</code></pre>

<p>But it does not work. I have been advised to start ""fresh"" with Homebrew (i.e. removing any trace from conda and macports and re-do the whole installation with Homebrew), but this looks like a rather drastic ""solution"" to me, also given the fact that I have <strong>A LOT</strong> of stuff installed already. </p>

<p>Just in case is of any use, the relevant lines in my .profile file look like this: </p>

<pre><code>setenv PATH /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
# anaconda path takes priority

<p>When I try to run with debugging my code, after a few calls of the dll GetJSON function i get the following error:<br>
""<em>Project test_OTL_SO.exe raised exception class EAccessViolation with message 'Access violation at address 005A2F8A in module 'my.dll'. Write of address 00610754'.</em>""<br>
However, this issue does not occur when I use the same local function GetJSON_local.<br>
Could anyone suggest what am I doing wrong here?</p>

"1298316","<p>I'm working on a piece of C++ software which runs on all Windows versions between Windows XP and Windows Vista. In my code, I developed a DLL which links against a standard library (the <a href=""http://qt.nokia.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Qt library</a>). Once my software is deployed, it's not unusual that the user doesn't have the exact same Qt build on his system but a slightly different configuration. There might be features disabled (so their Qt build doesn't export the same set of symbols) or the library might even be changed in ways which make the library binary incompatible to the original.</p>

<p>At some point, I'm loading my DLL via a LoadLibrary() call. This pulls in whatever Qt library is on the user's system. If I'm lucky, their Qt build is compatible with what I used while developing my DLLs, so LoadLibrary() succeeds. However, depending on the changes they did to their Qt build, the LoadLibrary() call sometimes fails with</p>

<ul>
<li>""The specified Module could not be found.""; this usually happens if their Qt build consists of less DLLs than my Qt build. So my DLL attempts to load e.g. QtFoo.dll but since this dll is not part of their Qt build, loading my DLL fails.</li>
<li>""The specified Procedure could not be found.""; this usually happens if they changes their Qt build so that certain features are disabled, which results in less exported symbols.</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is: how can I catch these errors gracefully? Right I'm simply using GetLastError() and then print either of the above two messages. However, it would be <em>much</em> more useful if I knew <em>which</em> module could not be found, or <em>which</em> procedure is missing. I noticed that when running an application in the explorer which links against a missing DLL, explorer manages to yield a nice 'The application foo could not be loaded since the required library blah.dll is missing'. Is there maybe some API available to get more information about why a LoadLibrary() call failed exactly?</p>

"36580394","<p>I'm working on a script that connects several ""client"" computers in a ""server"" computer, which then uses those clients to process several files, using FTP (pyftplib and pyftpdlib) for transfering files and results. </p>

<p>The script works by creating 3 folders on the server: Files, Processing and Results. The clients then connect to the server by FTP, access the ""Files"" folder, get the file for processing, then transfer it to the ""Processing"" folder while it is processing it. Then, when it finishes processing, the client delete the file from the processing folder and copies the results to the ""Results"" folder.</p>

<p>This is working correctly, both on the server and the client side. The problem i'm having is that, if one of the clients disconnects midway without generating an error (PC is disconnected, power outage), the server will threat this as if the client is still processing the file, and the file will stay in the ""Processing"" folder. What i want is a error checking function that, when this happens, the file on the ""Processing"" folder will return to the ""Files"" folder.</p>

In other words, what specifications should I look out for to determine whether a microcontroller can, if at all, run dlib. Note that Mbed devices run C++ code, so it would be possible to copy and paste the source code of dlib and compile it, but I want to know if this is possible before I purchase a board. Also, if the RAM and ROM of the board are not enough, I can always attach external RAM/ROM.</p>

"37180755","<p>I am compiling <code>dlib 18.18</code> on Windows 10 for <code>QT 5.6</code> with <code>MinGW 4.9.2</code>.</p>

<p>I have read all recommendations (<a href=""http://dlib.net/faq.html#Whyisdlibslow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dlib.net/faq.html#Whyisdlibslow</a>): AVX or SSE4 instructions, Release mode.</p>

<p>The example ""webcam_face_pose_ex.exe"" works like a charm and <em>really fast</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>

<p>But when I use the frontal_face_detector under QT the framerate is <em>really low</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>640x480 ~170 ms</p></li>
<li><p>1920x1080 ~1100 ms</p></li>
</ul>

<p>System configuration: Windows 10 (x64), Intel Core i5-3550, QT 5.6, OpenCV 3.1.0, MinGW 4.9.2</p>

<p>Tried all variations of using AVX/SSE4 instructions in dlib and opencv.
But I think that it's something different - since the example is fast.
Code used in QT is copy-pasted from the example as well, even without the GUI.</p>

<p>In Debug mode 640x480 frames take 6-7 seconds to process.</p>

"46167171","<p>I have a video of a patient doing cognitive tasks. The goal is to take each frame of the video, do face detection and landmark the mouth, then calculate the area bounded by the mouth landmarks. I used dlib and its python API to do this. </p>

<p>I ran into two problems. First, the patient is in a hospital bed and the camera view is slightly angled upward, looking up at the chin instead of directly at the face. The face isn't being detected in a decent number of frames, and if there is no face detected, the algorithm doesn't try to do landmarking so there are no mouth perimeter points. I am wondering if there is a way I can improve the face detection (maybe training the object detection specifically on a few frames of the patient?)</p>

<p>The second problem is that from frame to frame, the mouth landmarks can vary pretty significantly. I was hoping that at the end of this I could show a slow motion word being spoken and the mouth perimeter smoothly increasing and decreasing as the mouth opened and closed. But, a result is quite noisy with a good bit of variation. </p>

<p>I'm definitely method/platform agnostic. If anyone knows of a better, more accurate or robust way to do this, maybe with Matlab or OpenCV, I am open to chasing the lead.
Any guidance would be helpful. </p>

"42284122","<p>I'm using OpenCv and Dlib to execute <strong>facial recognition</strong> w/ landmarks, live from the <strong>webcam stream</strong>. The language is <strong>Python</strong>. It works fine on my macbook laptop, but I need it to run from a desktop computer 24/7. The computer is a PC Intel® Core™2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.40GHz 32bit running Debian Jessie. <strong>The drop in performance is drastic</strong> : there is a 10 seconds delay due to processing !</p>

<p>I therefore looked into <strong>multi-threading</strong> to gain performance :</p>

<ol>
<li>I first tried the sample code by OpenCv, and the result is great! All four cores hit 100%, and the performance is much better.</li>
<li>I then replaced the frame processing code with my code, and it doesn't improve performance at all ! Only one core hits the 100%, the other ones stay very low. <strong>I even think it's worse with multi-threading on.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I got the facial landmark code from the dlib sample code. I know it can probably be optimized, but I want to understand <strong>why am I not able to use my (old) computer's full power with multi-threading ?</strong></p>

<p>Without celery, as a regular single-thread program for face detection, everything works fine, but when I'm starting it as a task - the following error occurs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Task handler raised error: WorkerLostError('Worker exited prematurely:
  signal 11 (SIGSEGV).')</p>
</blockquote>

<p>on this piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>dlib.cnn_face_detection_model_v1(model)
</code></pre>

<p>And I don't get why, but with this:</p>

<pre><code>dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()
</code></pre>

<p>it works fine!</p>

<p>I know the conflict caused by <code>dlib</code> (or <code>BLAS</code>) not being thread-safe, but is there any way to disable multiprocessing either make celery workers work with this?</p>

<p><strong>UPD</strong>:
I have following project structure:</p>

<pre><code>./app/face_detector.py
./tasks.py
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>tasks.py</code> I'm using this on top of the file:</p>

<p><code>from app.face_detector import FaceDetector</code></p>

<p>the trick with import inside of task:</p>

<pre><code>@app.task
def foo():
    from app.face_detector import FaceDetector
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn't work at all and throws this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>no module named...</p>

<p>So, the solution from github thread was not understood by me or not working</p>

"51122909","<p>as I already mentioned in the title I need a 3D face model which contains mappings for the ibug 68-landmark mark-up. I want to calculate the headpose with OpenCV and dlib and use the pre trained dlib shape predictor that is why I need that specific mark-up.<br>
You can find the mark-up here::<br>
<a href=""https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/media/uploads/images/300-w/figure_1_68.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">i-bug 68-landmark mark-up</a></p>

<p>I already googled a lot but I can only find papers which either want money for the model or simply do not give you the mapping between the 3D face model and the  mark-up.</p>

<p>I have already found <a href=""https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this github project</a> but there are some points missing.</p>

<p>Could you tell me where I can find such a model or how to do the mapping by myself? That would be awesome :P.</p>

<p>I can easily get this to work with <code>calllib('sixense','sixenseInit')</code> since there is no input, but for the function sixenseGetAllNewestData I need to have a struct pointer. I realize that libstruct is what I need to use. However, I don't seem to be doing it right.</p>

<p>So I tried libstruct like so:</p>

<pre><code>libstruct('sixenseControllerData')

<p>and I get the error:</p>

If it is not possible to change the aspect ratio of the truth boxes, so as to train a single detector then how can I implement the above solution?</p>

"37293575","<p>My app scans folders for images and generates thumbnails from them to draw in a grid. I have a <code>OnDrawCell</code> handler, which adds a task to OTL to read required image, resize it (async) and draw back on to a cell (in main thread). This works fine, except when user scrolls quickly through the grid - this adds hundreds of tasks in to the queue. The queue works like FIFO (<em>first in - first out</em>), so user has to wait for all images to be processed before he sees ones he scrolled to.</p>

  end)
.Unobserved
.SetPriority(tpIdle)
.Schedule;

<p>How do I set up adding of the task to be executed in LIFO (<em>last in - first out</em>) manner?</p>

<p><em>Of course tasks that are already being processed should continue. I need the next one being taken from queue to be the one that was added last.</em></p>

"27744393","<p>I noticed something while testing some of my code on a <strong>Windows XP 32-bit virtual machine</strong>: My application always kept hanging. I never had such phenomenon on my <strong>Windows 7 64-bit</strong> computer but it was 100% reproducible on the VM.<br>
Via remote debugging i found out that the program was hanging on a call of <code>IOmniTaskControl.WaitForInit</code>. I set a breakpoint in <code>TOmniWorker.Initialize</code> but it was not triggered.</p>

<p>This is the method where I create the task:</p>

<pre><code>constructor TThreadedImportCache.Create(
  const AImportCacheConstructorParams: TImportCacheConstructorParamsWrapper);
begin
  inherited Create;

  FIsFlushingCounter := CreateCounter;

  FWorker      := TImportCacheWorker.Create(AImportCacheConstructorParams, FIsFlushingCounter);
  FTaskControl := CreateTask(FWorker, BuildUniqueIdent(TImportCacheWorker.ClassName));
  FTaskControl.Unobserved;
  FTaskControl.Schedule;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>When I replace <code>FTaskControl.Schedule</code>with <code>FTaskControl.Run</code> the task is initialized, runs fine and my application does not freeze.</p>

<p><strong>My question(s):</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have I been misusing the <code>Schedule</code> call? I thought it was the one to use, as it's not waiting to be actually run and the task is started some short time later. How is it supposed to be used?</p>

<p>or </p></li>
<li><p>Is this some problem/incompatibility concerning threading (via <em>OmniThreadLibrary</em>) on Windows XP?</p></li>

"37210203","<p>I want to execute long queries in a separate thread in order to be able to abort them and also to give feedback to the users. All of this is working but I sometimes get Access Violations because, I think, the processing of the OnNotice events is not done the right way and I would like to know the proper way of doing this.</p>

<p>I am using Devart's PgDAC and OmniThreadLibrary on Delphi 2010.</p>

<p>The PostgreSQL code that I execute is a stored procedure that contains things like :</p>

<pre><code>RAISE NOTICE 'ad: %',myad.name;
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the interesting parts of my code :</p>

<pre><code>procedure TFDecomptes.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  ThreadConnection := TPgConnection.Create(Self);
  ThreadConnection.Assign(DM.PgConnection1);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>ThreadConnection</code> is the TPgConnection that will be used to execute the query (within a separate thread).</p>

<pre><code>procedure TFDecomptes.BInterruptClick(Sender: TObject);
begin
  ThreadConnection.BreakExec;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>This is what the ""Interrupt query"" button does. I'm not sure this is very ""thread safe"" since it is used in the main thread but does something on the TPgConnection dedicated to the query-execution thread.</p>

<pre><code>procedure TFDecomptes.OmniEventMonitor1TaskMessage(const task: IOmniTaskControl; const msg: TOmniMessage);
begin
  case msg.MsgID of
    1: begin
         CalculationError:=msg.MsgData.AsString;
       end;
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>This is where I show errors happening during the thread execution (like SQL errors or query cancellation).</p>

<pre><code>procedure TFDecomptes.PgConnectionNotice(Sender: TObject; Errors: TPgErrors);
var s:String;
begin
  s:=Errors[Errors.Count-1].ToString;
  if copy(s,1,4)='ad: ' then begin
    delete(s,1,4);
    LAD.Caption:=s;
  end;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the OnNotice event processing. All it is doing is modify a Label's caption.</p>

<pre><code>procedure InternalExecQuery(const task: IOmniTask);
Var q:TPgSQL;
begin
  q:=Task.Param['pgsql'];
  Try
    q.Execute;
  Except
    On E:Exception do task.Comm.Send(1,e.Message);
  End;
end;

procedure TFDecomptes.StartClick(Sender: TObject);
begin
  ThreadConnection.OnNotice:=PgConnectionNotice;
  Timer1.Enabled:=True;
  CalculationTask := CreateTask(InternalExecQuery, 'CalculeDecomptes')
    .MonitorWith(OmniEventMonitor1)
    .SetParameter('pgsql', PgSQL)
    .Run;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is how the query is run.</p>

<p>So the <code>PgConnectionNotice</code> event (running in the main thread) is attached to the <code>ThreadConnection</code> (used in the query-execution thread) and this is what I suspect to be generating these random access violations.</p>

<p>I don't know how to handle this. Should I use some kind of <code>lock</code> when inside PgConnectionNotice (Synchronize ?).</p>

<p>This is what I tried :</p>

<pre><code>procedure TFDecomptes.OmniEventMonitor1TaskMessage(const task: IOmniTaskControl; const msg: TOmniMessage);
begin
  case msg.MsgID of
    1: begin
         CalculationError:=msg.MsgData.AsString;
       end;

    2: begin
         lad.caption:='Here';
       end;
  end;
end;

procedure TFDecomptes.PgConnectionNotice(Sender: TObject; Errors: TPgErrors);
begin
  // I am not using the passed string in this test
  CalculationTask.Comm.Send(2,Errors[Errors.Count-1].ToString);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The message sent in PgConnectionNotice (with MsgId=2) is never received by <code>OmniEventMonitor1TaskMessage</code>.</p>

<p>I have tried using <code>CalculationTask.Invoke</code> but didn't understand how to call it in order to pass a string parameter (I don't think Delphi 2010 allows for anonymous functions).</p>

<p>When I tried the simpler action of cancelling the query like this, it stopped cancelling the query :</p>

<pre><code>procedure TFDecomptes.DoTheInterrupt;
begin
  ThreadConnection.BreakExec;
end;

procedure TFDecomptes.BInterruptClick(Sender: TObject);
begin
  CalculationTask.Invoke(DoTheInterrupt);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>So I guess I shouldn't do the calls via <code>CalculationTask</code>. Should I store the task created in <code>InternalExecQuery</code> in a global variable and use that ?</p>

<p>So far, I made it to detect face rects out of AVMetaData and draw 68 dlib landmarks within those bounds on the image. When a detected head's roll-angle (roll-angle data is extracted from AVMetadata as well) is approxiamtely between -30 to 30 degrees, everything works fine. However, if the detected head rolls over 30 degrees, the facial landmarks would not align properly at all. Those 68 points would no longer rotate along the head, saying I'm hold my iphone in landscape orientation mode with home button on the left and the front camera on, the 68-drawn-dots face stays frontal.</p>

<p>I've tested with openGL(offscreen rendering) and openCV for rendering video images, they all generate the same results. The rendering approach seems irrelavant to my problem.</p>

<p>My questions are</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I properly align those dlib generated 68 points in spite of head roll angle? </li>
<li>Or, is it event possible for dlib to accurately detect any faces that rolls over 30 degrees?</li>

"2505712","<p>I'm writing a wrapper program that loads Winamp input plugins.  I've got it working well so far with quite a few plugins, but for some others, I get an error message at runtime when I attempt to call LoadLibrary on the plugin's DLL.  (It seems to happen mostly with plugins that were included with Winamp.)  A dialog appears and gives me the error code and message above.  This happens, for example, with the in_flac.dll and in_mp3.dll plugins (which come with Winamp).  Any ideas on how I can remedy this situation?</p>

<p>EDIT:
This basically iterates through the plugins in a directory and attempts to load and then free each one.  Some plugins produce the error I mentioned above, while others do not.</p>

My <code>LoadLibrary</code> call sets error <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681382(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND</code>/126</a> is this case.</p>

<p>Scenario 1:</p>

<pre><code>...\harry.exe ~ (a. 64 bit / b. 32 bit) 
...\sally.dll ~ (a. 32 bit / b. 64 bit)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>that is, the DLL is present, but in the wrong bitness.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will (in both cases a. and b.) set error <code>ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT</code>/193 from <code>LoadLibrary</code>.
Now it gets interesting:</p>

<p>Scenario 2.a: (invert the bitness for b.)</p>

<pre><code>set PATH=...\x86;...\x64;%PATH%
...\harry64.exe (depends on sally.dll in 64 bit)
...\x86\sally.dll
...\x64\sally.dll
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>that is, we have the executable and the DLL in both versions. <em>And</em> the executable can find the DLL of the correct bitness. <strong>But</strong> it will find the DLL of the <em>wrong</em> bitness first.</li>
</ul>

<p>My result: <em>This simply works.</em></p>

<p>When running in the VS 2015 debugger, I can see in this case:</p>

<pre><code>'harry.exe' (Win32): Loaded '...\x86\sally.dll'. Symbols loaded.
'harry.exe' (Win32): Unloaded '...\x86\sally.dll'
'harry.exe' (Win32): Loaded '...\x64\sally.dll'. Symbols loaded.
</code></pre>

<p>-> success</p>

<p>So, win-win, as long as the DLL of the correct bitness <em>can</em> be found it will be found.</p>

<p>The problems I have here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Both me and a co-worker always though this didn't work, namely that Windows would stop trying once it found the DLL with the wrong bitness.

<ul>
<li>Therefore: Has this always been the case?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Obviously, the loader is doing <em>something</em> with the wrong-bitness DLL -- does this ""probing"" have any side-effects? (apart from possibly slower load times.)</li>
<li>Is this bloody documented somewhere? (gotta love MSDN :-)</li>
</ul>

"16700810","<p>A customer is using our dll which is creating a child process which uses an open source library, which ultimately fails because of a call to LoadLibraryExW(), the last error returned is ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND.  This occurs on WinXP 32-bit, but not on other machines.  But we know the correct set of dependencies is installed and even in the same directory.</p>

<p>So we thought naturally, to use Dependency Walker to look for what dependency is missing on that particular machine.  Unfortunately it doesn't show any missing, just some delay-load warnings that aren't direct dependencies of the library.  In my experience using depends.exe has always revealed what the missing dependency is.</p>

<p>So at this point I've pulled my hair out trying to understand why I'm getting ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND if all of the library's dependencies are there?  The only other thing that makes this machine unique is it's very secure because it's used by the government, but if we were having an access/permissions issue I'd expect a different type of error code.</p>

<p>I've built a small Win32 executable that does nothing but call LoadLibraryExW() on the said library, when it's run from the same directory as the library is located, it loads the library without issue, on the customer's problematic machine.</p>

<p>One thing is that our product is an ActiveX plugin which launches a child process, the child process calls into the 3rd party library, the 3rd party library has the problematic LoadLibraryExW() call.  So maybe why it's failing is the context it's running (e.g. from the browser)?</p>

<p>When I try to explicitly load a dll from a Matlab's mex file (Visual Studio 2008, Windows 7 64bit, Matlab 2010b), The loading fails at runtime (I get a NULL handle). The same code works ok when used not in the mex file.</p>

<p>I aplogize that looks a little messy, I was trying to post a picture here, but it turns out I don't have enough reputation to do so.
Any suggestion is appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
I have traced down to the constructor in <code>ThorDetectorSwitch.dll</code>, which looks like following:</p>

<pre><code>ThorDetectorSwitch::ThorDetectorSwitch() : _mcSwitch(__uuidof(MCLControlClass))
{
    _A  = WstringToBSTR(L""A""); 
    _B  = WstringToBSTR(L""B"");
    _C  = WstringToBSTR(L""C"");
    _D  = WstringToBSTR(L""D"");

    _deviceDetected = FALSE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I set the break point at the first parenthesis, but it never gets into the function. Instead, it jumps to the exceptions. I suppose something wrong with the <code>MCLControlClass</code>, or<code>_mcSwitch</code>?</p>

"24906300","<p>We have an user interface developped in C++ using Boost 1.54.0 and QT 4.8.6.
This interface can call computation module. Each module must implement a (non pure) abstract class and be linked to a given .lib generated during interface compilation. After launching the interface, we indicate the path of the module dll which is loaded using QLibrary.</p>

<p>Everything worked perfectly with native C++ module but recently we started developping new modules using .NET 3.5 (C#). We want the interface can call this module so we decided to create an intermediate c++ project using \clr : this project implements the abstract class and can call managed .NET code thanks to \clr mode.</p>

<p>Now we have a big problem : we cannot achieve to load correctly the intermediate C++ problem. We tried with the kernel32 method LoadLibrary and we obtained an error code 193 (ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT). It is very surprising because all the projects are compiled for Win32/x86 and the computer is using a Windows Vista 32 bits.</p>

"31018864","<p>In Visual C++ 2013, I'm trying to export a function from a 'plugin' project:</p>

<pre><code>void registerFactories(FactoryRegister&lt;BaseShape&gt; &amp; factoryRegister);
</code></pre>

<p>Which is compliled into a dynamic dll which will be linked at runtime by an 'application' project. First I define the function pointer type:</p>

<pre><code>    typedef void (*RegisterFactoriesType)(FactoryRegister&lt;BaseShape&gt; &amp;);
</code></pre>

<p>Which is used as:</p>

<pre><code>        auto registerFactories = (RegisterFactoriesType)GetProcAddress(dll, ""registerFactories"");
        if (!registerFactories) {
            if (verbose) {
                ofLogWarning(""ofxPlugin"") &lt;&lt; ""No factories for FactoryRegister&lt;"" &lt;&lt; typeid(ModuleBaseType).name() &lt;&lt; ""&gt; found in DLL "" &lt;&lt; path;
            }
            FreeLibrary(dll);
            return false;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>However, the <code>GetProcAddress</code> returns NULL.</p>

<p>I can confirm that I can export C functions (using <code>extern ""C""</code>) and import them from the same DLL using <code>GetProcAddress</code>, but I importing the C++ function fails. e.g. this works:</p>

<pre><code>extern ""C"" {
    OFXPLUGIN_EXPORT void testFunction(int shout);
}
</code></pre>

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>auto testFunction = (TestFunction)GetProcAddress(dll, ""testFunction"");
if (testFunction) {
    testFunction(5);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my presumption is that I need to somehow consider the mangled name which is exported for <code>registerFactories</code>. Since it needs to deal with C++ types, ideally I want to do this without <code>export ""C""</code>.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All you need to do is create an empty console project. Then add <strong>dlib/all/source.cpp</strong> to it and add the folder containing the <strong>dlib folder</strong> to the #include search path.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Again, note that dlib will only be able to work with jpeg and png files if you link in libjpeg and libpng. In Visual Studio, the easiest way to do this is to add all the source files in the dlib/external folder into your project and also define the <strong>DLIB_PNG_SUPPORT</strong> and <strong>DLIB_JPEG_SUPPORT</strong> preprocessor directives. If you don't know how to configure Visual Studio then you should use CMake as shown above since it will take care of everything automatically.</p>

<p>PPS: The 10ms here is just for quick reproduce the problem, not in real situation. So don't bother ask why?</p>

<p>OK,the conclusion is: simply not add too much nodes at single node if you need to update this node periodically, the more node the more cpu time to update them.</p>

<p>I followed the code sample in <a href=""http://dlib.net/dnn_face_recognition_ex.cpp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dlib samples</a> and did the following:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;matrix&lt;rgb_pixel&gt;&gt; faces;
for (auto face : detector(img1))
{
    auto shape = sp(img1, face);
    matrix&lt;rgb_pixel&gt; face_chip;
    extract_image_chip(img1, get_face_chip_details(shape, 150, 0.25), face_chip);
    faces.push_back(move(face_chip));
}
</code></pre>

<p>this is for the first image and then did the same for the second image:</p>

<pre><code>for (auto face : detector(img2))
{
    auto shape = sp(img2, face);
    matrix&lt;rgb_pixel&gt; face_chip;
    extract_image_chip(img2, get_face_chip_details(shape, 150, 0.25), face_chip);
    faces.push_back(move(face_chip));
}
</code></pre>

<p>then i continue  as per the mentioned link:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;matrix&lt;float, 0, 1&gt;&gt; face_descriptors = net(faces);
std::vector&lt;sample_pair&gt; edges;
for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; face_descriptors.size(); ++i)
{
     for (size_t j = i; j &lt; face_descriptors.size(); ++j)
     {
          if (length(face_descriptors[i] - face_descriptors[j]) &lt; threshold)
              edges.push_back(sample_pair(i, j));
     }
 }
 std::vector&lt;unsigned long&gt; labels;
 const int num_clusters = chinese_whispers(edges, labels);
//etc
</code></pre>

<p>and now comes my question. img1 is an image already available to the code that is read when i need to match a specific person. (ie if I want to mach personX, img1 is read using </p>

<pre><code>load_image(img1, ""personX.jpg"");
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of having the image saved, i was trying to save the features and load them to reduce the time spent the extraction of features. so what I did is I moved the first for loop at a different function (enrollment like)  and made it something like this:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;matrix&lt;rgb_pixel&gt;&gt; faces;
for (auto face : detector(img1))
{
    auto shape = sp(img1, face);
    matrix&lt;rgb_pixel&gt; face_chip;
    extract_image_chip(img1, get_face_chip_details(shape, 150, 0.25), face_chip);
    serialize(""personX.dat"") &lt;&lt;face_chip;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then at the recognition instead of the loop i used</p>

<pre><code>matrix&lt;rgb_pixel&gt; face_chip;
deserialize(""personX.dat"")&gt;&gt;face_chip;            
faces.push_back(move(face_chip));
</code></pre>

<p>and the rest of the code from the extraction of img2 onward remained the same. the code compiled. But during execution when i reach the recognition i end up with the following error:</p>

<p>**************************** FATAL ERROR DETECTED ****************************</p>

<p>Error detected at line 216.

<p>for a little game I need to display an octagon (<a href=""http://de.narutopedia.eu/images/a/a4/Skill_kakashi.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">Like this one</a>)</p>

<p>The shape adapts itself to certain values I get from the database. My Problem is, I have absolutely no idea how to launch into it. I neither know the formula for my purpose, nor I know how I could draw such a shape in PHP.</p>

<p>In general I'm relatively good at PHP. So I`d be happy about theoretical approaches to a solution and not necessarily code =)</p>

<p>The most common error is a missing dependency of the DLL being loaded (also applies for dependencies of dependencies, and so on): <em>The specified module could not be found</em>. Unfortunately, this error is not very helpful in order to know <em>which</em> dependency is.</p>

<p>I know I can use <em>Dependency Walker</em> to find it manually (actually it's how I'm doing it right now), but the process is quite complex since, as you noted by the <code>LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DEFAULT_DIRS</code> flag, dependencies can be located in different directories. The search path is specified before loading the plugin using <code>AddDllDirectory</code>, and restored with <code>RemoveDllDirectory</code> after it is loaded.</p>

<p>For reason above, using <em>Dependency Walker</em> is quite tedious: for each plugin that fails I have to add the directories used to load that plugin (there are many plugins and each one may have a different search path set).</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> is there any way to know, at runtime, the name of the module that wasn't found? I'm the developer of the plugins too, so I can modify them if necessary.</p>

<p><em>Additional notes:</em> Using Visual Studio 2010, and almost all the dependencies (DLLs) have exported symbols (.lib file associated and linked with the plugin).</p>

<p>My problems are:
1. Very high memory usage for the whole dataset (30+Gb)
2. Training on partial dataset does not yield very high recall rate, 50-60 percent as compared to frontal_face_detector's 80-90 (testing on sub-set of images not used for training).
3. The detectors work badly on low resolution images and thus fail in detecting faces that are more than 1-1.5 meters deep.
4. Training run time increases significantly with SVM's C parameter that I have to increase to achieve better recall rate (I suspect that this is just overfitting artifact) </p>

<p>My original motivation in trainig was 
a. gaining the ability to adapt to the specific environment where the camera is installed by e.g. hard negative mining.
b. improving detection in depth + run time by reducing the 80x80 window to 64x64 or even 48x48.</p>

<p>So here is the part that I do not understand: the code works fine for when I upload a .jpeg, but if it is a PNG or a GIF, it brings up a page that says, 'The image '127.0.0.1:8888' cannot be displayed because it contains errors.' I'm supposing it must not have the correct Header MIME type, but could it be something else? </p>

<p>When I select a .jpeg, it uploads just fine to my image folder and it generates a thumbnail to my Thumbnail folder like I want it to. </p>

<p>But as soon as I try it with PNG and GIF, it fails. I must be missing something obvious?</p>

<p>Is this code any good for what I'm trying to accomplish?</p>

<p>Let's say on page yellow.php the row id # 1 is called and on page green.php, row id # 2 is called. </p>

<p>Both rows link to the same jpg image, but I would like for the code (the ) to have the color from the ""tekst"" in the table as filename instead, so if you right click the image, properties would state that the filename would be eg. green.jpg instead of testimage.jpg - is this possible?</p>

<p>Someone told me that GDlib perhaps could do the trick, but I have no knowledge of this.</p>

<p>Thank you so much in advance</p>

<p>EDIT --</p>

<p>Sorry for the late response to update this question.</p>

<p>What I am trying to accomplish by doing this is in regards to SEO. I'm in the process of developing a website with several languages (I believe it'll be in 10 languages, when done). For each page there will be images, and I would like to be as good in SEO as possible and therefore I would like to have the images named in their respective languages without having to make 10 identical copies of the images only with the filename in difference. Therefore I am looking for a way to write a filename in a specific language ""on the fly"". </p>

<p>E.g. I have an image named ""2012-nice-red-mustang.jpg"" in my root folder on my webhotel. When I access my page in english, the filename of the image would be as the original, but when viewing the spanish page with the image, the filename has been renamed to ""2012-bonito-rojo-mustang.jpg"" (where the translated filename is retrieved from a table in a database). </p>

<p>I hope this clarifies the problem and what I am trying to do.</p>

Now I know how to crop the mouth using dlib and facial landmarks (which is what this script does).</p>

<p>The question is how do I modify the original image such that it remains entirely the same except without the mouth? Basically I want to cut it out.</p>

<pre><code>predictor_path = ""/home/victor/facial-landmarks/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat""

i = 0
for f in glob.glob(os.path.join(faces_folder_path, ""*.jpg"")):
    print(""Processing file: {}"".format(f))
    img = cv2.imread(f)

    dets = detector(img, 1)
    print(""Number of faces detected: {}"".format(len(dets)))
    for k, d in enumerate(dets):
        print(""Detection {}: Left: {} Top: {} Right: {} Bottom: {}"".format(
            k, d.left(), d.top(), d.right(), d.bottom()))

    shape = predictor(img, d)
    i += 1

    xmouthpoints = [shape.part(x).x for x in range(48,68)]
    ymouthpoints = [shape.part(x).y for x in range(48,68)]
    maxx = max(xmouthpoints)
    minx = min(xmouthpoints)
    maxy = max(ymouthpoints)
    miny = min(ymouthpoints)

    pad = 10

    filename = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(f))[0]

    crop_image = img[(miny-pad):(maxy+pad),(minx-pad):(maxx+pad)]
    img = cv2.subtract(img, crop_image)
    imshow(crop_image, 1)
    imshow(new_image, 1)

    cv2.imwrite(str(filename) + '.jpg',crop_image)
</code></pre>

<p>Using cv2.subtract yields the following error: error: OpenCV(3.4.1) /io/opencv/modules/core/src/arithm.cpp:659: error: (-209) The operation is neither 'array op array' (where arrays have the same size and the same number of channels), nor 'array op scalar', nor 'scalar op array' in function arithm_op</p>

<p>I've also thought about using image subtraction, is that possible?</p>

<p>Even if it will be some black or white box or circle instead of the mouth, it'd be perfect.</p>

<p>Note: I would use GIMP or Photoshop, but I'm dealing with thousands of selfies, so it's not really an option. </p>

<p>I'm trying to unload some native dll from my process, so I'm getting it's handle and then calling FreeLibrary until the ref count goes to zero and so FreeLibrary returns false... but it never does:</p>

<pre><code>IntPtr pDll = DllLoadingImports.LoadLibrary(dllTounLoad);
//throw if pDll == IntPtr.Zero
while(DllLoadingImports.FreeLibrary(pDll));
</code></pre>

<p>The code runs and never returns.
Also the process explorer shows the dll still loaded.</p>

<p>More background:</p>

<p>I'm trying to unload native library loaded by use of DllImport and I'm using trick described here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/2445558/2308106"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/2445558/2308106</a>
It's for prototyping purposes so I don't have to care about possible consequnces... but I'm puzzled why the library won't unload</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>:
I found that similar behavior can be achieved by specifying GET_MODULE_HANDLE_EX_FLAG_PIN flag in <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683200(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GetModuleHandleEx</a> function (which can be called from within DllMain on dll load).</p>

<p>The dll I'm trying to unload is python.dll (more precisely python36.dll). But haven't found usage of this flag within python source code. DllMain itself is empty.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>:
I was asked for minimum executable example - so here it goes:
It uses pythonnet library (version 2.3.0) - that's the PythonEngine calls.</p>

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
public class PythonUnloadTest
{
    public static class DllImports
    {
        [DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")]
        public static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string dllToLoad);

        [DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")]
        public static extern bool FreeLibrary(IntPtr hModule);
    }

    [Test]
    public void PythonLoadUnload()
    {
        const string PythonDll = @""PythonEngine\python36"";

        PythonEngine.Initialize();
        //locking etc not included for simplicity

        //Replace module with 'sys' (or some others) and dll can be unloaded
        var module = PythonEngine.ImportModule(""numpy"");
        module.Dispose();

        IntPtr pythonDllHandle = DllImports.LoadLibrary(PythonDll);
        if (pythonDllHandle == IntPtr.Zero)
        {
            throw new Exception(""Dll not loaded"");
        }

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; i++)
        {
            if (!DllImports.FreeLibrary(pythonDllHandle))
            {
                return;
            }
        }

        Assert.Fail(""Python not unloaded"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Regardless of this specific case</em> (python and pythonnet and loading of numpy) - there still needs to be some phenomenon that prevents process from being able to unload dlls by calling FreeLibrary. I'm suspecting instalment of some hooks or calling GetModuleHandleEx with above mentioned flag... I'll try to inspect numpy source. But if there are any specific tips what should I be looking for - I'd appreciate those</p>

"50338206","<p>My problem is that dlib is running very slow on Ubuntu. I've always used it in Windows, and it works just great. Now I'm working on Ubuntu 16.04, and the speed is many times slower. I've used the dlib's issue template from Github, but I didn't upload it there because I'm sure is a mistake I'm making, not a dlib's bug or something like that.</p>

<h2>Expected Behavior and Current Behavior</h2>

<p>I'm using dnn and svm modules of dlib. The speed when I use them on Windows is many times faster than when I use them in Ubuntu. I know it must be something wrong I'm doing, but I can't find what. The trained files come from Windows, I'm just using them to predict on Ubuntu.</p>

<h2>Steps to Reproduce</h2>

<ul>
<li>Open cmake gui version 3.11.1.  </li>
<li>Specify CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles (the codeblocks version is 16.01)</li>
<li>Check USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS  </li>
<li>Check DLIB_NO_GUI_SUPPORT</li>
<li>Configure and Generate  </li>
</ul>

<p>That's all I do to configure the project. Also, I have installed in my computer Intel Performance Libraries, so mkl and openmp are being used. No CUDA (but this is the same as in Windows).  The version of these libraries is 2018.2  </p>

<p>I've also checked the flags being used when compiling, and they seem ok. Here's one as an example:</p>

"44457048","<p>Using neural networks for face recognition, the network will generate a ""face descriptor"" that is, depending on the network of course, often a 128D vector that describes a face (""In general, if two face descriptor vectors have a Euclidean between them less than 0.6 then they are from the same person, otherwise they are from different people."" <sup><a href=""https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/python_examples/face_recognition.py#L102"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>I am trying to develop a photographs application that features face recognition, although I do not know how to store the face descriptor of a person. The question is <strong>NOT</strong> how to serialize them, but when there are hundreds of different photos of the same person, yet each yielding a different face descriptor (because the angle, lighting and etc. are different), how to choose which one to store? Presumably, there should be a way to ""improve"" the descriptors as more and more photos are processed, <strong>without</strong> training the neural network.</p>

"53563169","<p>For my next university-project i will have to teach a Convoluted Neural Network how to denoise a picture of a face so i started digging the we for datasets of faces. I stumbled upon this dataset (<a href=""http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CelebA</a>) with 200k+ pictures of people and i found the first few problems: there are too many pictures to do basic computation on them.</p>

<p>I should:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open each image and make a numpy array out of it (dlib.load_rgb_image is fine)</li>
<li>Find a face it, use the 5 point shape predictor to find the eyes and align them</li>
<li>Rotate the picture so that the eyes are in a straight horizontal line</li>
<li>Crop the face and resize it to 256x256 (i could choose 64x64 but its not a huge time saver)</li>
<li>Make a copy and add artificial noise to it </li>
<li>Save them both to two different folder</li>
</ol>

<p>On a pc that the university gave me i could do about 40ish image each minute, around 57k images every 24hours.</p>

<p>To speedup thing i have tried threads; one thread for each pictures but the speedup is about 2-3 images more per-minute.</p>

<p>This is the code i'm running:</p>

<pre><code>### Out of the threads, before running them ###
def img_crop(img, bounding_box):
    # some code using cv2.copyMakeBorder to crop the image

MODEL_5_LANDMARK = ""5_point.dat""
shape_preditor = dlib.shape_predictor(MODEL_5_LANDMARK)
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()


### Inside each thread ###
img_in = dlib.load_rgb_image(""img_in.jpg"")
dets = detector(img_in, 1)
shape = shape_preditor(img_in, dets[0])

points = []
for i in range(0, shape.num_parts):
    point = shape.part(i)
    points.append((point.x, point.y))

eye_sx = points[1]
eye_dx = points[3]

dy = eye_dx[1] - eye_sx[1]
dx = eye_dx[0] - eye_sx[0]
angle = math.degrees(math.atan2(dy, dx))

center = (dets[0].center().x, dets[0].center().y)
h, w, _ = img_in.shape
M = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D(center, angle + 180, 1)
img_in = cv2.warpAffine(img_in, M, (w, h))

dets = detector(img_in, 1)
bbox = (dets[0].left(), dets[0].top(), dets[0].right(), dets[0].bottom())
img_out = cv2.resize(imcrop(img_in, bbox), (256, 256))
img_out = cv2.cvtColor(img_out, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

img_noisy = skimage.util.random_noise(img_out, ....)
cv2.imwrite('out.jpg', img_out)
cv2.imwrite('out_noise.jpg', img_noisy)
</code></pre>

<p>My programming language is Python3.6, how i can speedup things?</p>

<p>Another problem will be loading the whole 200k images into memory as numpy array, from my initial testing 12k images will take around 80seconds with a final shape of (12000, 256, 256, 3). Is there a faster way to achieve this?</p>

"13255845","<p>I have some code which is trying to load a Dll. </p>

<p>I have encountered an odd 'error' with this. When trying to load the dll from an absolute path, I get a Non-Null HMODULE that gives no windows error codes on a GetLastError call (i.e. GetLastError returns '0' or success according to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681382%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">msdn</a>). When calling into a function in this dll, I get incorrect values.</p>

<p>This behavior is peculiar, because if, instead, I switch the current directory to be that of my current dll using SetCurrentDirectory and use a relative path call to LoadLibrary, I get correct values.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet describing the situation:</p>

<p>Using absolute path:</p>

<pre><code>std::string libLoc = get_dll_location(); // Get the directory of this dll
HMODULE myDLL = LoadLibraryA(libLoc.c_str()); // Non-null value
DWORD lastError = GetLastError(); // returns 0

MyObj * value = UseDLL(myDLL); // bad value
</code></pre>

<p>Using relative path:</p>

<pre><code>SetCurrentDirectory(""c:\\path\\containing\\dll\\""); // hard coded path to dll's folder
HMODULE myDLL = LoadLibrary(""myDll.dll"");  // Non-null value
MyObj * value = UseDLL(myDLL);  // Good value
</code></pre>

<p>I'd really like to avoid having to use SetCurrentDirectory, because the application using this Dll may be multi-threaded and require that the directory stays the same. </p>

<p>Any insight on this issue would be much appreciated. Hopefully, this is just a minor bug on my part.</p>

"39734176","<p>I have <code>proj1.dll</code> that has a dependency to another DLL, <code>proj2.dll</code>. I compiled <code>proj1.dll</code> against the import library that was output by the compiler when compiling <code>proj2.dll</code> in VS2013. I also exported the public functions I am interested in using. So now I have two separate DLLs that all conform to the 'cdll' standard. </p>

<p>I want to use <code>proj1.dll</code> in Python but I am running into the following issue:</p>

<pre><code>import ctypes

# Crashes saying no entry point for ""some_func"" in proj2.dll
ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(""C:\myfolder\proj1.dll"")

ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(""C:\myfolder\proj2.dll"") # Loads fine
ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(""C:\myfolder\proj1.dll"") # Loads fine if proj2 is loaded first
</code></pre>

<p>Calling into this DLL from Python previously worked when I built <code>proj2</code> as a static library and linked against it in <code>proj1</code>. The two DLLs exist in the same folder. I even attempted adding the folder's path to my PATH environment variable to see if this was a pathing issue but nothing changed.</p>

<p>I was under the assumption that Windows would load <code>proj1.dll</code> and then load the dll's dependencies. Am I wrong? Does the caller (Python) have to load the dependency DLLs first? Anyone know why this is happening?</p>

"2751936","<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
I'm maintaining a plugin for an application. I'm Using Visual C++ 2003.  </p>

<p>The plugin is composed of several DLLs - there's the main DLL, that's the one that the application loads using LoadLibrary, and there are several utility DLLs that are used by the main DLL and by each other.<br>
Dependencies generally look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>plugin.dll -> utilA.dll, utilB.dll</li>
<li>utilA.dll -> utilB.dll</li>
<li>utilB.dll -> utilA.dll, utilC.dll</li>
</ul>

<p>You get the picture.</p>

<p>Some of the dependencies between the DLLs are load-time and some run-time.  </p>

<p>All the DLL files are stored in the executable's directory (not a requirement, just how it works now).</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong><br>
There's a new requirement - running multiple instances of the plugin within the application.<br>
The application runs each instance of a plugin in its own thread, i.e. each thread calls functions exported by plugin.dll. The plugin's code, however, is anything but thread-safe - lots of global variables etc..  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, fixing the whole thing isn't currently an option, so I need a way to load multiple (at most 3) copies of the plugin's DLLs in the same process. </p>

<p><strong>Option 1: The distinct names approach</strong><br>
Creating 3 copies of each DLL file, so that each file has a distinct name. e.g. plugin1.dll, plugin2.dll, plugin3.dll, utilA1.dll, utilA2.dll, utilA3.dll, utilB1.dll, etc.. The application will load plugin1.dll, plugin2.dll and plugin3.dll. The files will be in the executable's directory.  </p>

<p>For each group of DLLs to know each other by name (so the inter-dependencies work), the names need to be known at compilation time - meaning the DLLs need to be compiled multiple times, only each time with different output file names.  </p>

<p>Not very complicated, but I'd hate having 3 copies of the VS project files, and don't like having to compile the same files over and over.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2: The side-by-side assemblies approach</strong><br>
Creating 3 copies of the DLL files, each group in its own directory, and defining each group as an assembly by putting an assembly manifest file in the directory, listing the plugin's DLLs.<br>
Each DLL will have an application manifest pointing to the assembly, so that the loader finds the copies of the utility DLLs that reside in the same directory. The manifest needs to be embedded for it to be found when a DLL is loaded using LoadLibrary. I'll use mt.exe from a later VS version for the job, since VS2003 has no built-in manifest embedding support.</p>

<p>I've tried this approach with partial success - dependencies are found during load-time of the DLLs, but not when a DLL function is called that loads another DLL.<br>
This seems to be the expected behavior according to <a href=""http://omnicognate.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/winsxs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> - A DLL's activation context is only used at the DLL's load-time, and afterwards it's deactivated and the process's activation context is used.  </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Works with <code>ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED</code> as expected - runtime loading of DLLs uses the original activation context of the loading DLL.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong><br>
Got any other options? Any quick &amp; dirty solution will do. :-)</p>

<p>Will <code>ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED</code> even work with VS2003? <strong>Edit:</strong> It does.</p>

<p>Comments will be greatly appreciated.</p>

"49129477","<p>I'm currently trying to implement the DLIB library to my UWP application. I followed the Dlib compile instructions from <a href=""http://dlib.net/compile.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://dlib.net/compile.html</a>. I generated the dlib project for ""Windows Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"" and made a Release build using CMAKE.</p>

<p>In the project I want to use the Dlib library I added a C++ Runtime Component project and set the following properties for the project:  </p>

<ul>
<li>\...\dlib-19.9\source to VC++ Directories->Include Directories</li>
<li>\...\dlib-19.9\build\dlib\Release to VC++ Directories->Library Directories</li>
<li>dlib_release_64bit_msvc1912.lib to Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>I've also added the following Preprocessor Definitions:</p>

<pre><code>DLIB_NO_GUI_SUPPORT
DLIB_PNG_SUPPORT
DLIB_JPEG_SUPPORT
NDEBUG
</code></pre>

<p>But now the Runtime Component project won't compile anymore and gives me the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol __imp_ExitProcess in \...\dlib_release_64bit_msvc1912.lib(pngerror.obj) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I remove the DLIB_PNG_SUPPORT from the Preprocessor Definitions it will compile, but of course it will say that I need to add DLIB_PNG_SUPPORT to the Preprocessor Definitions. </p>

<p>I have no clue how to solve this error. Am I doing something wrong or how can I solve this error?</p>

"50139091","<p>I'm trying to dynamically load a <code>dll</code> and call a function from it at runtime. I have succeeded in getting a working pointer with <code>GetProcAddress</code>, but the program crashes if the function from the <code>dll</code> uses the <code>stdlib</code>. Here's the code from the executable that loads the <code>dll</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

typedef int (*myFunc_t)(int);

int main(void) {
  using namespace std;
  HINSTANCE dll = LoadLibrary(""demo.dll"");
  if (!dll) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; ""Could not load dll 'demo.dll'"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 1;
  }
  myFunc_t myFunc = (myFunc_t) GetProcAddress(dll, ""myFunc"");
  if (!myFunc) {
    FreeLibrary(dll);
    cerr &lt;&lt; ""Could not find function 'myFunc'"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 1;
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; ""Successfully loaded myFunc!"" &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; myFunc(3) &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; myFunc(7) &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; myFunc(42) &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; ""Successfully called myFunc!"" &lt;&lt; endl;
  FreeLibrary(dll);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's code for the <code>dll</code> that actually works:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

extern ""C"" {

  __declspec(dllexport) int myFunc(int demo) {
    //std::cout &lt;&lt; ""myFunc("" &lt;&lt; demo &lt;&lt; "")"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return demo * demo;
  }

}

int main(void) {
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that the <code>main</code> method in the <code>dll</code> code is just to appease the compiler)</p>

<p>If I uncomment the line with <code>std::cout</code> however, then the program crashes after the <code>cout &lt;&lt; ""Sucessfully loaded myFunc!"" &lt;&lt; endl;</code> line but before anything else gets printed. I know there must be some way to do what I want; what do I need to change for it to work?</p>

<p>I have a few objects in a genric list. I want to capture each of this object in anonymous method and execute this method as a separate OTL Task.</p>

<p>This is a simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>program Project51;

type

type

  Readln;
end.
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the result:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W3dXW.png"" alt=""Captured objects ID""></p>

<p>As you can see, capturing seems to work fine in the main thread. However, I do not know if a pointer to an object has been captured or only its ID field?</p>

<p>When I try to capture the object and pass the anonymous method to <code>CreateTask</code> function things become weird.</p>

<p>First of all, only the third instance of <code>TMyObject</code> seemed to be captured. Second of all, I've got four messages in console log despite the fact that I have only three objects in generic list. The second behaviour is inconsistent, sometimes I've got three messages in console, sometimes I've got four.</p>

<p>Please explain me the reason for two issues mentioned above and propose a solution that eliminates the problem and allows me to pass each instance of object to a separate OTL task. (I do not want to use regular <code>TThread</code> class.)</p>

<p>The only things the API function knows about with regard to the target DLL function are via these parameters passed to it. Could someone please illustrate how you would implement this function?  I am assuming that (on Windows) LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress must be used to call the ""DLLFunction"" within the ""FullyQuialifiedDLLName"" DLL.  So at the heart of the problem seems to be how to use GetProcAddress in a generic way when the parameter types and return types vary, and cannot be systematically listed or known ahead of time.</p>

"4609983","<p>Am using calllib to access an external DLL from matlab.  The DLL has a function in it, with a signature that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct resultStruct {
    double E;
    double W;
    double N; 
    double S;
    double Z;
    double Y;
} RESULT_STRUCT;


typedef struct inputStruct {
    double A;  
    double B; 
    double C; 
} INPUT_STRUCT;

RESULT_STRUCT calc(
    const INPUT_STRUCT* input);
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to invoke this in matlab, </p>

<pre><code>loadlibrary('calc.dll','calc.h');
input.A = 1;
input.B = 2;
input.C = 3;

[res, st] = calllib('calc','calc',input);
</code></pre>

<p>I get the error:</p>

<pre><code>??? Error using ==&gt; calllib
The function return type is not supported.
</code></pre>

<p>Surprisingly, google shows up no hits on that error message, and there is nothing in the documentation for calllib: <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/calllib.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/calllib.html</a></p>

<p>My guess, is that since the function is returning a structure, matlab is puking.  But there's nothing in the documentation to suggest that.  Although, none of the examples matlab provides, includes a structure as an output variable.</p>

"50033276","<p>I am creating a Python wrapper for a C DLL using python ctypes. I am having trouble updating a pointer to value in memory with python. </p>

<p>In this example I have a DLL that has a register callback function. A invoke callback function that creates unsigned char variable, passes a pointer to that variable to the callback function, then prints the updated value of that variable. </p>

<p>What I expected to happen is that the python function <code>callbackUpdateValue</code> would update the value of <code>foo</code>, and the updated value would be printed in C DLL <code>DoCallBack</code> function. The value of <code>0</code> is printed instead of the expected value of <code>99</code> </p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong>  In python how do I update the value of <code>foo</code> in <code>callbackUpdateValue</code> so that it can be printed in the C DLL <code>DoCallBack</code> function?</p>

<p>I have minimized my code as much as possible </p>

<p><strong>DLL C++ Code</strong> </p>

<p>The DLL has two functions. One to register up a callback, the other to invoke the callback and print the results. </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
typedef void(*FPCallback)(unsigned char * foo);
FPCallback g_Callback;

extern ""C"" __declspec( dllexport ) void RegisterCallback(void(*p_Callback)(unsigned char * foo)) {
    g_Callback = p_Callback ; 
}

extern ""C"" __declspec( dllexport ) void DoCallBack() {
    unsigned char foo = 0 ; 
    g_Callback( &amp;foo ); 
    printf( ""foo=%d\n"", foo); 
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Python code</strong> </p>

<p>The python code sets up the call back function, then calls the DoCallBack function from the DLL. </p>

<pre><code>from ctypes import *

def callbackUpdateValue( foo ):
    foo = 99 

customDLL = cdll.LoadLibrary (""customeDLL.dll"")

# RegisterCallback
CustomDLLCallbackFUNC = CFUNCTYPE(None, POINTER( c_ubyte))
CustomDLLCallback_func = CustomDLLCallbackFUNC( callbackUpdateValue )
RegisterCallback = customDLL.RegisterCallback
RegisterCallback.argtypes = [ CustomDLLCallbackFUNC ]
RegisterCallback( CustomDLLCallback_func ) 

# DoCallBack
DoCallBack = customDLL.DoCallBack

# Call the callback 
DoCallBack()

<p>The problem occurs when trying to match the captured image matrices to be used by the dlib. In dlib I have to convert the cv::Mat of the image that I retrieved from the Zed camera to be in dlib's special format that is used within the example as in below:</p>

<pre><code>cv::Mat temp = sl::zed::slMat2cvMat(left); // converts the zed Mat to openCV mat     
cv_image&lt;bgr_pixel&gt; cimg(temp); // converts the opencv matrix to dlib matrix`

<p>I receive the following error when doing the second step is as follows:</p>

<p>The problem I am running into, seems to be coming up in the comments on that page as well. ""imagecolorat() [function.imagecolorat]: 320,1 is out of bounds."" So, I added a error_reporting(0) to the top of the file (not really the solution), and it seems to work sometimes while other times it just doesn't do anything.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

"48598568","<p>I am getting facial landmarks using dlib. I have dataset of more than 1000 faces. I want to make a comparison of these 1000 images with some unknown image. To decrease the database search time, i want to cluster these 1000images in to 10 different clusters based on the 68 facial landmark features of dlib. Currently, I am clustering based on chin to nose distance of different face images. </p>

<p>Problem: Each image of same person is generating different facial landmarks which is effecting the distance calculated from chin to nose tip. Please find the screenshot of csv  <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4e2cn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4e2cn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<li>4th - Face chin to nose tip euclidean distances</li>
<li>5th - 68 long dlib facial landmarks seperated as chin, eye ....</li>
</ol>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it a right way to cluster images based on facial landmarks ?  If not, what is the best way to cluster face images/face groupping to make databse searc more efficient for more images ?</li>

"31396077","<p>I wrote a C++ interface dll to call some key image processing statistical measuring methods from Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP) library so we can exploit SIMD capabilities. I was able to pass two 2D Matlab arrays over into the function using calllib</p>

<pre><code>A = single( rand(3,4) );
B = single( rand(3,2) );

pOut = calllib('IPPInterface', 'myFunc', A' , B' , size(A,1), size(A,2) , size(B,1), size(B,2) );

"29012943","<p>I'm interfacing Matlab and C-code in order to be able to directly use some C-functions in Matlab. I know the prototype of these functions but the code inside could change. 
In order to interface it all, I use loadlibrary and calllib in Matlab and I don't want to use MEXFiles.</p>

<p>In the C-code, some structures are defined. Nevertheless, the one which defines the base component of the code could change : it contains some structure and variables, but some other structures can be added in this one, and I would like Matlab to be able to deal with all that.</p>

<p>But, as Mathworks says it : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nested structures or structures containing a pointer to a structure are not supported. However, MATLAB can access an array of structures created in an external library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I can't store directly a nested structure in Matlab. For example, the main component is a structure (a). This one contains an other structure (b). And (b) contains pointers to functions.
If I directly store (a) in a variable using libstruct, when I call a C-method with (a) in argument, we can see that the pointers are lost. The worst is that the C-code knows what is the pointer to the structure (b), but he can't access to the pointed funcitons.
Nevertheless, by creating this structure (b) before in Matlab, it works, but it's specific to (b) and I can't do the same for other nested structures.</p>

<p>That's why I was thinking that I must prevent Matlab from looking the type of the variable. I just must give it the pointer to the structure and lock all is in relation with this pointer in order to be able to pass this pointer in argument of a C-function with calllib.</p>

<p>So that's my question : do you know if I can lock a part of the memory which contains the structure (a) and all of what is in relation with? And do you think I can prevent Matlab from looking what is this pointer?</p>

<p>In fact, I just want to create a nested structure in a C-function and to re-use it in an other C-function, but to call these two C-functions with Matlab (without using MexFiles). </p>

<p>In most cases, fault addr is equal to ""seg_file_end"". (We can verify it by the info of <code>readelf -l libWebCore_UC.so</code>.)
And if one user crashed like these, he will crash again and again. (some users crashed hundreds of times.)</p>

<p>And we have checked so's size before we loaded it, its size must be the same as we expect. </p>

<p>Most of these kind of crash is sigbus, sometimes is SIGSEGV.
Anyone has any idea about this?</p>

"29394018","<p>I'm using DLIB's object detection example and trying to train it using 7 images containing 14 images of a bottle. These images are primarily around 200x300 pixels, although 2 are much larger (the 1500x2000 pixel realm). The large images contain only 1 example each, and although the images are really big, the bottles themselves match roughly the same size of the bottles in the smaller training images. My sliding window is 70x240 which is about the average size of the bounding boxes I drew.</p>

<p>It has now been minimizing the objective function for 8+ hours on a Windows Server Machine with 384GB of RAM running Windows 8 64bit. There's no way it's supposed to take this long. It's still going--it's on iteration 125...</p>

<p>The documentation mentions training a face detector on the provided set of faces in ""on the order of 10 seconds."" Could it be because I'm running in MS Visual Studio 2012 with arguments passed into the  debugger? Even when I ran the face detector example, it took a solid 30-45 minutes for training--a lot more than 10 seconds.</p>

<p>This is what I have so far:</p>

find_package(dlib)

<p>If I remove the <code>SHARED</code> from <code>
add_library(face_align SHARED src/mylib.cpp)</code> the project builds successfully. This makes me think that <code>dlib:dlib</code> is pointing to the static library. I see that there is a <code>dlib:dlib_shared</code> but no success linking to this one either.</p>

"38896847","<p>I have a problem with System.load and System.loadLibrary of java (I tried both). I googled about them a lot but could find a solution for my exact problem. I have a java program that needs to call some .Net assemblies. For this reason, we built an application that includes interopability. This is the working flow, from left to right: Java – JNI – C++\CLI – C#</p>

<p>The problem is in my Java code. The program is running successfully when I copy all my dependent DLLs into Java installation folder (ProgramFiles\Java\bin). When running from Java\bin everything is fine, we reach to .Net assemblies. However, this is not an acceptable solution. Java\bin is for Java’s own binary files directory and we need to run it from another directory.
Here is the Java code portion:</p>

<pre><code>static{
        System.out.print(""Library(java.library.path):"");
        System.out.print(""\n GetProperty \n"");
        System.out.println(System.getProperty(""java.library.path""));
System.loadLibrary(""AudioProcessingAgent"");
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
        CsharpConsumer nc = new CsharpConsumer();
        nc.registerAssemblyHandler("".\\"");
…
// Sample code of registerAssemblyHandler from this directory: http://codefry.blogspot.jp/2012/01/calling-net-dlls-from-java-code-without.html?m=1
}
</code></pre>

<p>I made sure that my directory is included in my PATH and in java.library.path
I found another workaround for the problem, in case I compile my java and convert my jar file into an Exe file this also would work fine from the path where the exe and the dlls located.  However, this is also not acceptable since we need to embed it into a java applet. Thus, I need to understand why system.load and system.loadLibrary fails out of java\bin. 
I got this error when I run it from out:</p>

<pre><code> # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
#
#  Internal Error (0xe0434352), pid=10840, tid=9208
#
# JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (7.0_79-b15) (build 1.7.0_79-b15)

</code></pre>

<p>I read about this error also. This is the reason why I added the function "" registerAssemblyHandler"" and it helped to run it from java\bin.</p>

"42601609","<p>First, I am new to C++ and dlib but I have successfully built the examples and started working on my own project. Things have been progressing smoothly until I try to save a jpeg. Attempting to compile code using <code>dlib::save_jpeg</code> throws a linker error and I cannot track down the solution. I have attempted to add <code>#define DLIB_JPEG_SUPPORT</code> above and below my <code>#include</code>s but no luck. I am using XCode and used <code>cmake -G ""Xcode"" ..</code> when I compiled the examples. Relevant code below. Since I am on a Mac, I have added header and library search paths for X11 (for dlib gui), OpenCV, and DLIB. I have libjpeg.dylib and linked that to my project with and without <code>#define DLIB_JPEG_SUPPORT</code> in <code>main.cpp</code>. Is there some other build setting I need to specify? Thank you in advance for your help. </p>

<p>Finally, I have seen other questions and pages about dlib and libjpeg issues but no luck yet. And yes I have source.cpp included in the project. </p>

"48000826","<p>We have a plugin system that calls functions in dlls (user-generated plugins) by dlopening/LoadLibrarying the dll/so/dylib and then dlsyming/GetProcAddressing  the function, and then storing that result in a function pointer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to some bad example code being copy-pasted, some of these dlls in the wild do not have the correct function signature, and do not contain a return statement. </p>

<p>A dll might contain this:</p>

<pre><code>extern ""C"" void Foo() { stuffWithNoReturn(); } // copy-paste from bad code
</code></pre>

<p>or it might contain this:</p>

<pre><code>extern ""C"" int Foo() { doStuff(); return 1; } // good code
</code></pre>

<p>The application that loads the dll relies on the return value, but there are a nontrivial number of dlls out there that don't have the return statement. I am trying to detect this situation, and warn the user about the problem with his plugin. </p>

<p>This naive code should explain what I'm trying to do:</p>

<pre><code>typedef int (*Foo_f)(void);
Foo_f func = (Foo_f)getFromDll(); // does dlsym or GetProcAddress depending on platform
int canary = 0x42424242;
canary = (*func)();
if (canary == 0x42424242)
   printf(""You idiot, this is the wrong signature!!!\n"");
else
   real_return_value = canary;
</code></pre>

<p>This unfortunately does not work, canary contains a random value after calling a dll that has the known defect. I naively assumed calling a function with no return statement would leave the canary intact, but it doesn't.</p>

<p>My next idea was to write a little bit of inline assembler to call the function, and check the eax register upon return, but Visual Studio 2015 doesn't allow __asm() in x64 code anymore. </p>

<p>I know there is no standards-conform solution to this, as casting the function pointer to the wrong type is of course undefined behavior. But if someone has a solution that works at least on 64bit Windows with Visual C++, or a solution that works with clang on MacOS, I would be most delighted.</p>

"48393158","<p>I am creating an Autodesk Revit add-in in C#. Output of this project is a DLL itself. Within this project, I am loading another unmanaged DLL by calling:</p>

<p><code>IntPtr pDll = LoadLibrary(""E:\\Rep3DLib\\builds\\Release\\Index.dll"");
int a = Marshal.GetLastWin32Error();</code></p>

<p>Within debugger, I see that <code>pDll</code> has value 0 and <code>a</code> has value 127 (Error: The specified procedure could not be found.). This is surprising because I am not even looking any particular procedure within the DLL. I just want to load the DLL.</p>

<p>Now I delete the unmanaged DLL from <code>E:\\Rep3DLib\\builds\\Release\\Index.dll</code> and in the above code, <code>a</code> has value 126 (Error: The specified module could not be found.). This does make sense. It also means that when the DLL is present at the correct location, the code is able to find it but somehow it's looking for a procedure which it's not able to find.</p>

<p>To debug this problem, I created another project within the same solution. Here's the code for this project:</p>

<pre><code>namespace testIndex {
    class Program {

        [DllImport(""kernel32.dll"", SetLastError = true)]
        public static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string dllToLoad);

        static void Main(string[] args) {
            IntPtr pDll = LoadLibrary(""E:\\Rep3DLib\\builds\\Release\\Index.dll"");
            int a = Marshal.GetLastWin32Error();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this, <code>pDll</code> has a non-zero value and I am able to call the functions defined within the <code>Index.dll</code>.</p>

<p>Note that both the projects have target platform as x64. I also verified that if I build the Revit add-in and run it on a different machine, it does find the DLL. So somehow it's not finding the DLL only on my machine although the path <code>E:\\Rep3DLib\\builds\\Release\\Index.dll</code> is definitely correct.</p>

<p>Any idea what could be wrong?</p>

"10759129","<p>so I have this project in java that uses a jni .dll i wrote (which i've aptly named jniusb) that gives access to usb-hid devices.  i've been using it for several months now without any notable issues until yesterday when i tried to launch my program from the jar instead of directly from netbeans.  after a little debugging i characterized my issue as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>clicking on the jar icon starts my program without loading the dll.  displaying the error messages in my gui revealed ""no jniusb in java.library.path"" even though i copied my dll to the java binaries folder (which always seemed to work in the past).</p></li>
<li><p>i tweaked the code to find the current directory and use ""System.load"" (with the dll copied to the same folder as my jar) instead of ""System.loadLibrary"".  this approach threw the error ""C:\Users\bpaik\Documents\NetBeansProjects\JniUsb\dist\jniusb.dll: Can't load AMD 64-bit .dll on a IA 32-bit platform"".  this made me scratch my head since i am most definitely working on an AMD 64-bit platform and running out of netbeans works with the same dll...</p></li>
<li><p>running the jar from the command prompt (with either java.exe or javaw.exe) loads the dll just fine.  i thought that maybe this meant that i was having admin privileges issues so i tested the theory by going to the java executable and granting admin privileges, but this did not change anything.  (and i'm also pretty sure i've used load/loadlibrary before without admin...) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>i am no java expert so i've pretty much exhausted my debugging abilities and am now hoping that someone with a little more experience than i will recognize the issue i've described, thanks.</p>

<p>UPDATE: so i've fixed the problem but I still have no idea what is going on.  i did a x86 build of my .dll and threw it into the folder with my jar and everything loaded/worked just fine.  so i guess somehow (even though i set the default program for my jar to be the x64 JVM) the jar i built with the x64 library in Netbeans is running in a 32-bit JVM.  to sum things up:</p>

<ol>
<li>my jar is built with the x64 library in netbeans and runs fine with the x64 dll when launched from the command prompt.</li>
<li>when launching the jar from the icon (with default program set to x64 java) my program and JVM somehow switch to a 32-bit JVM and work fine when i use the 32-bit version of my dll.</li>
<li>trying to explicitly run my jar with the 32-bit java doesn't work at all.  my gui doesn't display and the command prompt briefly opens/closes... </li>

"11137969","<p>Let's say I have to recursively iterate over items stored in a tree structure in the background and I want to walk this tree using multiple threads from a thread pool (one thread per ""folder"" node). I have already managed to implement this using several different low and high-level approaches provided by the OmniThreadLibrary.</p>

<p>However, what I haven't figured out yet is how to properly detect that the scan has actually completed, i.e. that every last leaf node has been processed.</p>

<p>I found various examples on the net that either checked whether <code>GlobalThreadPool.CountExecuting + GlobalThreadPool.CountQueued &lt;= 0</code> or that used a <code>IOmniTaskGroup.WaitForAll()</code>. Unfortunately, none of these approaches appears to work for me. The check always returns <code>True</code> too early, i.e. when there still are some tasks running. None of the examples I looked at used recursion though - and those that did did not use a thread pool - is this maybe just not a good combination in the first place?</p>

<p>Here's a (very) simplified example code snippet of how I'm trying to do this at the moment:</p>

<pre><code>procedure CreateScanFolderTask(const AFolder: IFolder);
begin
  CreateTask(ScanFolder)
    .SetParameter('Folder', AFolder)
    .Schedule();
end;

procedure ScanFolder(const ATask: IOmniTask);
var
  lFolder,
  lCurrentFolder: IFolder;
begin
  if ATaks.CancellationToken.IsSignalled then Exit;

  lCurrentFolder := ATask.Param['Folder'].AsInterface as IFolder;

  DoSomethingWithItemsInFolder(lCurrentFolder.Items);

  for lFolder in lCurrentFolder.Folders do
    begin
      if ATaks.CancellationToken.IsSignalled then Exit;
      CreateScanFolderTask(lFolder);
    end;
end;

begin
  GlobalOmniThreadPool.MaxExecuting := 8;
  CreateScanFolderTask(FRootFolder);

  // ??? wait for recursive scan to finish

  OutputResult();
end.
</code></pre>

<p>One example implementation for the wait that I have tried was this (based on an <a href=""http://delphi.about.com/od/kbthread/a/threaded-delphi-tasks-thread-pool-otl-omnithreadlibrary-example.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">example found on About.com</a>):</p>

<pre><code>  while GlobalOmniThreadPool.CountExecuting + GlobalOmniThreadPool.CountQueued &gt; 0 do
    Application.ProcessMessages;
</code></pre>

<p>But this appears to always exit immediately right after the ""root thread"" has finished. Even when I add an artificial delay using <code>Sleep()</code>-calls it still always exits too early. It seems that there occurs a ""gap"" between one task being struck off the list of executing tasks and the ones that were scheduled inside that task to be added to the list of queued tasks...</p>

<p>Actually, instead of waiting for the scan to finish, I would very much prefer to use an event handler (also, I'd rather not use <code>Application.ProcessMessages</code> as I will need this in form-less applications, too) and I already did try with both <code>IOmniTaskControl.OnTerminated</code> and using a <code>TOmniEventMonitor</code> but as these fire for every finished task I still somehow need to check whether the current one was the last one which again boils down to the same problem as above.</p>

<p>Or is there maybe a better way to create the tasks that would avoid this problem?</p>

"2335476","<p>I am working on a Windows application (EXE) that uses multiple DLLs.  Development is in VCExpress 2005 (VC 8.0), using C only.</p>

<p>Some of these DLLs are plug-ins/add-ons/extensions that are dynamically loaded using <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684175(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>LoadLibrary</code></a> according to a configuration file read by the EXE.  </p>

<p>Importantly: the application must be portable (in the sense of able to run from a USB flash drive or similar without installation), and the plug-in DLLs may not be in the same folder as the application EXE (legacy reasons).</p>

<p>With MSVC6 this is straightforward: compile, link, distribute EXE and DLLs.</p>

<p>With MSVC8 the C Runtime Library (MSVCRT) is no longer distributed with the OS, so one cannot rely on it being installed.  To satisfy the portability requirement I need to use a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa375674(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">private assembly</a>.  All EXEs and DLLs have had their manifests embedded.</p>

<p><strong>My problem</strong>: the plug-in DLLs loaded via <code>LoadLibrary()</code> do not find the private assembly that is in the EXE's folder, so attempting to load them fails unless the <code>Microsoft.VC80.CRT</code> assembly is installed in winSxS.</p>

<p><strong>The catch</strong>: if the manifests are removed from the plug-in DLLs, everything works.</p>

<p><strong>My questions</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the problem case, Windows doesn't seem to be following either the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374224(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Assembly searching sequence</a> or the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dynamic link library search order</a>.  Specifically it is looking for the private assembly in the path from which the DLL was loaded, not from which the application (EXE) was loaded.<br>
I have attempted to verify this by putting the assembly adjacent to the DLL, and changing the current directory (to rule out related to working directory cases), and get the expected behaviour.  Can anyone else confirm that this is the normal behaviour when using <code>LoadLibrary</code> with SxS?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I right in assuming that without a manifest, the DLL falls back to non-SxS load order which is finding <code>msvcr80.dll</code> (rather than the assembly manifest <code>Microsoft.VC80.CRT.manifest</code>) in the EXE's folder?</p></li>
<li><p>If I am right about (1) and (2), what do I lose by just excluding the manifest from the DLL?  Rephrased, why shouldn't I solve my problem by just excluding the manifest?</p></li>

<p>In our Delphi XE4 application we use a TOmniEventMonitor to receive messages from other tasks. As long as this is running in the main thread, it works fine, but once I put the same code in a task, the TOmniEventMonitor stops receiving messages. I have included a simple example of this below -- clicking Button_TestInMainThread results in a file being written as expected, clicking Button_TestInBackgroundThread does not. Is this by design, or is there some way to get this working while still using TOmniEventMonitor?</p>

<h2>Additional Observations</h2>

<p>With the following code it seems to be possible to successfully use a TOmniEventMonitor within a background thread. This really is a very clumsy solution -- an IOmniTwoWayChannel gets created but not used in any meaningful way -- but as soon as I try to simplify the code by commenting out either of the lines marked ""don't remove!"", HandleTaskMessage doesn't get called any more. Can anybody tell me what I am doing wrong here?</p>

<p>I installed :
I compiled dlib with :

libcudnn7-dev_7.2.1.38-1+cuda9.2_amd64.deb</p>

<p>and when I try dnn_metric_learning_on_images_ex it gives:</p>

<p>objs.size(): 4

"48452299","<p>I'm successfully opening and displaying a .avi video using OpenCV and I need this to go through OpenCV because I want to learn how to make OpenCV and dlib communicate.</p>

<p>For my understanding, a Mat has to be converted into an array2d in order to be processed by dlib so here's my first attempt:</p>

<pre><code>cv::VideoCapture cap(""/home/francesco/Downloads/05-1.avi"");
cv::namedWindow(""UNLTD"", CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE);

while(1)
{
    cv::Mat temp;
    cv_image&lt;bgr_pixel&gt; cimg(temp);

    std::vector&lt;rectangle&gt; faces = detector(cimg);
    cout &lt;&lt; faces.size() &lt;&lt; endl;

    cv::imshow(""UNLTD"", temp);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>This returns the error</p>

<pre><code>Error detected in file /usr/local/include/dlib/opencv/cv_image.h.
Error detected in function dlib::cv_image&lt;pixel_type&gt;::cv_image(cv::Mat) [with pixel_type = dlib::bgr_pixel].

Failing expression was img.depth() == cv::DataType&lt;typename pixel_traits&lt;pixel_type&gt;::basic_pixel_type&gt;::depth &amp;&amp; img.channels() == pixel_traits&lt;pixel_type&gt;::num.
The pixel type you gave doesn't match pixel used by the open cv Mat object.
     img.depth():    0
     img.cv::DataType&lt;typename pixel_traits&lt;pixel_type&gt;::basic_pixel_type&gt;::depth: 0
     img.channels(): 1
     img.pixel_traits&lt;pixel_type&gt;::num: 3
</code></pre>

<p>I tried swapping bgr_pixel to rgb_pixel but without any luck.
Looking around the internet somebody mentioned that the img.depth() is zero, therefore I should use unsigned char instead of rgb_pixel.</p>

<p>First thing: my video is playing in colors, so it does have 3 channels, I don't understand why it should be interpreted as a 1 channel image.</p>

<p>The strange thing is that, making that change from rgb_pixel to unsigned char, makes the software work but ZERO faces are detected on that video stream (that is the video of a guy talking and the face on the same video is detected with no problems by dlib on python.</p>

<p>I don't understand what I'm doing wrong </p>

"2187425","<p>First, COM is like black magic for me. But I need to use COM dll in one project I'm working on.</p>

<p>So, I have a DLL I am developing and I need some functionalities that are available in a separate COM DLL.  When I look to the COM DLL with Depends.exe I see methods like DllGetClassObject() and other functions but none of the functions I'm interested in.</p>

<p>I have access to the COM DLL (legacy) source code but it's a mess and I'd rather like to use the COM DLL in binary like a big black box not knowing what's going on inside.</p>

<p>So, how can I call the COM DLL functions from my code using LoadLibrary?  Is it possible? If, yes, could you give me an example of how to do it?</p>

<p>I'm using Visual Studio 6 for this project.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

"2730990","<p>We've been plagued for several years by occasional reports from customers about a non-descript error message ""Cannot set allocations"" that appears on startup of our app. We have never been able to reproduce the problem in our own test environments so far. I have now run out of ideas for attempting to track this down. Here's a collection of observations that have accumulated over time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Error message text reads ""Cannot set allocations"" (note absence of punctuation).</li>
<li>The window title simply reads ""Error"" (or the localized equivalent).</li>
<li>The ""Cannot set allocations"" text is always in English regardless of OS locale.</li>
<li><p>I have so far not been able to locate the DLL or EXE containing the message text.</p></li>
<li><p>Google is chock full of <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%22cannot+set+allocations%22"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reports of this error</a> for a variety of different products - but no solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>The only unifying aspect between the affected products I could make out so far was that they all appear to come in the form of DLLs that load into third-party processes (such as addins for Visual Studio or Windows Explorer shell extensions).</p></li>
<li><p>Our app is actually a shareware COM-addin for MS Outlook, written in Delphi (i.e. native code - no .NET).</p></li>
<li><p>The prime suspect in our case is the third-party licensing wrapper that we're using which decrypts and uncompresses our DLL into memory on the fly. Obviously I couldn't simply give an unprotected version of our app to the affected customers to verify this suspicion. Maybe the other vendors that this has been reported against are using similar products.</p></li>
<li><p>Debug versions of the protection wrapper supplied to us by the licensing vendor yielded no results: The log files looked exactly the same as from sessions where the error did not occur. Apparently the ""inner"" DLL gets decrypted and uncompressed all right but for some reason still fails to get loaded by the host process.</p></li>
<li><p>By creating an unprotected ""loader"" DLL we have been able to pinpoint the occurrence of the error somewhere behind the <code>LoadLibrary</code> call that is supposed to load our DLL into memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Extensive logging and global exception hooks in our own code (both the unprotected loader and the protected ""core""-DLL) yielded no results at all. The error is obviously raised somewhere else.</p></li>
<li><p>The problem described in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/546051"">this earlier question of mine</a> was very probably prompted by the same issue. This was before we created the unprotected loader stub.</p></li>
<li><p>The error only occurs at about 1-2% of our customers - whereas typically all installations at any affected customer's site are affected the same.</p></li>
<li>Sometimes the error goes away after we release a new version but often it will come back again after a couple of weeks or months.</li>
<li>Once the error has started to occur on a machine it does so consistently.</li>
<li><p>The error never occurs while connected to the affected machine via remote access (e.g. VNC, RDP, TeamViewer, etc.) and none of the affected customers are within travel distance from us so all we have to go by is log files and ""eye-witness reports"".</p></li>
<li><p>One customer reported that the error message dialog apparently was non-modal, i.e. he was able to simply move the dialog box to the side and continue working with the application (minus the functionality that our DLL would have provided). Not sure whether this is universally true in all other occurrences, too.</p></li>
<li><p>In some cases customers have been able to permanently rid themselves of the error by disabling or uninstalling other addins from other vendors that were sharing the host application with our own product.</p></li>
<li><p>The error has so far been observed on Windows XP, Vista and 7.</p></li>
<li><p>During the last few weeks we had a surge of reports from Outlook 2003 / Windows 7 users. Could the situation have been made worse by a recent Windows/Office-update?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone have any experience with this error at all?</p>

<p>Or any more ideas for investigating this?</p>

You must #define DLIB_JPEG_SUPPORT and link to libjpeg to read JPEG files.
Do this by following the instructions at http://dlib.net/compile.html.

Note that you must cause DLIB_JPEG_SUPPORT to be defined for your entire project.
So don't #define it in one file. Instead, use a compiler switch like -DDLIB_JPEG_SUPPORT

<p>Let's say P.exe depends on A.dll, B.dll and C.dll (implicit linking), they're private modules of P.exe.</p>

<p>Now I use CreateProcess with CREATE_SUSPENDED flag to launch P.exe, after that I use CreateRemoteThread to call LoadLibrary in target process to load Inject.dll, and in the same way call an initialize function of Inject.dll to do real work (things you can't do in DLLMain).</p>

<p>It works. But I found that calling to LoadLibrary makes A.dll, B.dll and C.dll load too - not just Inject.dll. From the Output of Visual Studio, they even load before Inject.dll, this is not what I want. You know, Inject.dll does not depend on any third-party DLLs, in fact it just depends on kernel32.dll and user32.dll.</p>

"11345724","<p>I have a DLL called tccdvc.dll which is part of an SDK available here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.commell.com.tw/Download/Driver/Industrial%20Peripheral/Driver/MPX-885/MPX-885%20SDK%20(1.2)/SetupCOMMELL%20MPX-885_20100627.rar"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.commell.com.tw/Download/Driver/Industrial%20Peripheral/Driver/MPX-885/MPX-885%20SDK%20(1.2)/SetupCOMMELL%20MPX-885_20100627.rar</a></p>

<p>The DLL was written in C++ and examining the DLL shows it was linked with linker version 6.0, so I assume it was written with VC++ 6.0. The DLL does not come with source code, only a .lib file and a .h file. All exported functions are declared as extern ""C"" (so no C++ name mangling) and with APIENTRY (so __stdcall).</p>

<p>I have written a C++ (not .NET) program in Visual Studio 2010 on Windows XP SP3 (32-bit) to access this tccdvc.dll. This works fine, both when using the provided .lib file and when using LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress. I have also written a C++ DLL (let's call it mywrapper.dll) that uses tccdvc.dll and, again, in two versions, one using the .lib file, the other using LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress. Again, this works fine. This mywrapper.dll uses the __cdecl calling convention. It contains a function called InitMyWrapperDLL() which loads the tccdvc.dll. The version of mywrapper.dll that uses LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress has code like this:</p>

<pre><code>typedef int (APIENTRY *TCCPROCTYPE01)();

HMODULE TCCmodule;
TCCPROCTYPE01 Proc_TCC_DVCOpen;

extern ""C"" __declspec(dllexport) void InitMyWrapperDLL ()
{ TCCmodule = LoadLibrary(""tccdvc.dll"");
  Proc_TCC_DVCOpen = (TCCPROCTYPE01)GetProcAddress(TCCmodule, ""TCC_DVCOpen"");
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, using a C++ front-end, this works fine. However, when calling it from C# (on the same machine), the LoadLibrary(""tccdvc.dll"") call returns NULL. In C#, I am using:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""mywrapper.dll"", CallingConvention=CallingConvention.Cdecl, CharSet=CharSet.Ansi, ExactSpelling=true, EntryPoint=""InitMyWrapperDLL"")]
private static extern void InitMyWrapperDLL ();

...

InitMyWrapperDLL();
</code></pre>

<p>When compiling mywrapper.dll using the provided tccdvc.lib file instead, it fails as well, with error code 0x8007045a (also known as 1114), meaning the DLL initialisation failed, and it gives mywrapper.dll as the name of the DLL. It turns out that the failure is because of tccdvc.dll, which gets loaded through mywrapper.dll.</p>

<p>Using the following in C# fails as well:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""tcc.dll"", CallingConvention=CallingConvention.StdCall, CharSet=CharSet.Ansi, ExactSpelling=true, EntryPoint=""TCC_DVCOpen"")]
private static extern Int32 TCC_DVCOpen ();

...

TCC_DVCOpen();
</code></pre>

<p>I have also used ""unsafe"" in the declaration, but that did not make any difference. Predictable, because LoadLibrary() fails, so it does not even get to TCC_DVCOpen().</p>

<p>To pinpoint the problem, I used the LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress version of mywrapper.dll again and put the following code in my C# program:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")]
private static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary (string lpLibFileName);

[DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")]
private static extern Int32 GetLastError ();

...

IntPtr hdll1 = LoadLibrary(""mywrapper.dll"");
IntPtr hdll2 = LoadLibrary(""tccdvc.dll"");
Int32 errcode = GetLastError();
</code></pre>

<p>After this, hdll1 has a valid value, but hdll2 is 0. When using the .NET 3.5 Framework, GetLastError() returns 0x8007045a again, but when using .NET 4.0, GetLastError() returns 0 (ERROR_SUCCESS).</p>

<p>I used Process Monitor by Sysinternals to get more information and I can see that tccdvc.dll is being read and mapped successfully. Nothing that Process Monitor displays gives me any hint as to why it fails when using C#, but not when using C++.</p>

<p>Any ideas?
Thanks!</p>

<p>I am using a set of python scripts that have been developed externally. They require a <em>rather</em> standard lib (<code>liblzma</code>) and use <code>LoadLibrary</code> from <code>ctypes</code> to load it--via a pathname.  My problem is that these scripts need to run on several different linux installs and potentially more in the future. <em>The full file name of the <code>liblzma</code> shared library, as well as it's location, varies from system to system.</em> I've done testing against the various lib versions and there have found no conflicts.</p>

<p><strong>What I really need</strong> is a way to determine the base name of the <em>installed libs</em> in order to pass the appropriate name to <code>LoadLibrary</code>. </p>

<p>I've considered just using <code>ldconfig -p</code> to print existing libs and parsing the output to find the lib names.  Any other ideas?</p>

"48661106","<p>ML and DLib beginner here, so please excuse me if the question meanders a little. </p>

<p>I've been looking at some of the example projects in the Dlib documentation, and roughly understand the example found here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://dlib.net/dnn_introduction_ex.cpp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://dlib.net/dnn_introduction_ex.cpp.html</a></p>

<p>The example looks straightforward, enough for me to grasp how to compile a working example.</p>

<p>What I would like to do however, is attempt to use a <code>loss_mean_squared_multioutput</code> layer in the place of the <code>loss_multiclass_log</code> found in the example, as I think it will be a better fit for my model.</p>

<p>To give a brief, high level description of the problem I have, it's a regression problem with 5 outputs. On training, I would like to feed in an 'image', and train the network on how valuable any one of those 5 outputs might be, in relation to that input.</p>

<p>So for example, if I feed in (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>input = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>I would like the output to produce something like this</p>

<pre><code>output = [0, 0.1, 0, 0.5, -1]
</code></pre>

<p>With that in mind, if the labels for <code>loss_mean_squared_multioutput</code> are <code>matrix&lt;float&gt;</code>, is this roughly how I should go about using it?:</p>

<pre><code>loss_multiclass_log&lt;fc&lt;5...

When this app runs on my developer machine (32 bit Win7 on my laptop, 64 bit Win7 on my desktop comp), sometimes it causes 998 error. After rebooting the developer machines, this problem disappears. This happens on the test server (virtual machine on a linux, Win Server 2008 R2), but after restarting it disappears too. Not easy to reproduce for this reason.</p>

<p>Hard to understand the reason, when I the DLL-s load the dependecy walker, it shows absolutely no problem with them, the two dependecies are Kernel32.DLL and MSVCRT.DLL. Today this error happened starting my app from command line. I loaded the app into VS2010, and started, and the same dll-s was loaded without any problem. Stopping it I started my app from command line again, and it loaded the DLL-s too. </p>

<p>These DLL-s are developed not by me but a 3rd company, so I cannot see the source code of the DLL-s. Any idea of what happening? </p>

I did These steps:</p>

<p>1.Download <strong>jpegsr9a</strong>.zip from <a href=""http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsr9a.zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and unzipped it.</p>

<p>2.Download <strong>WIN32.mak</strong> and paste it into the jpeg root folder</p>

<p>3.Open  Developer Command Prompt from visual studio 2013 tools</p>

<p>4.In command prompt type : <strong>nmake -f makefile.vc setup-v10</strong></p>

<p>5.After these steps jpeg.sln created ,the note is when I open jpeg.sln in VS2013 the message come:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lBPoz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lBPoz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>maybe base of the problem start from here , I don't know</p>

<p>6.Build the jpeg.sln with the proper configuration (I built it many times with different configurations, recently I built it using <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YirxxtFpJIU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> .)
at the end of building the error came :<strong>""unable to start jpeg.lib""</strong>
but in release folder or debug folder (depend on configuration) jpeg.lib was created</p>

<ol start=""7"">
<li>open main project which is using DLIB for detecting face,I added jpeg root folder to Additonal Include Directory and jepegroot/release to Additional Libarary Directories ,then change the UseLibrary dependencies to ""yes"" and I also added jpeg.lib to the dependecies.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have been playing with <a href=""https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EasyHook</a> for a while now and have been very successfull with statically linked DLLs. Now I tried to hook a function from a DLL that is dynamically loaded from the Host Application using the same approach as with the statically linked DLLs.</p>

<p>In this scenario, the hook failed to work. I got the following exception when trying to create the hook:</p>

<pre class=""lang-pascal prettyprint-override""><code>System.DllNotFoundException: The given library is not loaded into the current process.
</code></pre>

<p>The Exception is very correct in stating that the library is <strong>not yet</strong> loaded, but the Host/hooked Process is about to load it in a few ns/ms after it started (which totally doesn't matter).</p>

<p>The tutorials and the results from my searches on the internet only covered hooking a statically linked DLL. I haven't found anything about dynamically loaded DLLs. One solution that comes to mind: Hook <code>LoadLibrary</code> and <code>GetProcAddress</code> and wait for the right winapi call to do the desired replacement.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any other/an easier way to hook functions from a dynamically loaded DLL?</strong></p>

<p>There is one constraint: The external program cannot be changed to use the DLL in a static way.</p>

<hr>

<p>To facilitate a possible solution, here are some snippets that show what I want to hook:</p>

<p>First, this is the DLL with the <code>AddIntegers</code> function that I want to replace (Code is in Delphi)</p>

<pre class=""lang-pascal prettyprint-override""><code>library Calculate;

function AddIntegers(_a, _b: integer): integer; stdcall;
begin
  Result := _a + _b;
end;

exports
   AddIntegers;

begin
end.
</code></pre>

<p>Second, this is the program using the above DLL using the exported <code>AddIntegers</code> function.</p>

<pre class=""lang-pascal prettyprint-override""><code>program HostConsole;
{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}

uses
  Winapi.Windows, System.SysUtils;

var
  n1, n2, sum: Int32;

  // Variables for DLL Loading
  h: HMODULE;
  AddIntegers: function(_a, _b: integer): integer; stdcall;

begin
  try
    // Load Library
    h := LoadLibrary('Calculate.dll');
    if h = 0 then
    begin;
      raise Exception.Create('Cannot load DLL');
    end;

    // Load function
    AddIntegers := GetProcAddress(h, 'AddIntegers');

    if not Assigned(AddIntegers) then
    begin
      raise Exception.Create('Cannot find function');
    end;

    Write('Enter first number: ');
    Readln(n1);

    Write('Enter second number: ');
    Readln(n2);

    // To the calculation
    sum := AddIntegers(n1, n2);

    Writeln('The sum is ', sum);
  except
    on E: Exception do
      Writeln(E.ClassName, ': ', E.Message);
  end;

  // Unload Library
  FreeLibrary(h);

  Readln;

end.

"1875552","<p>Say I have a DLL that has the following static/global:</p>

<pre><code>ClassA Object;

<p>Along with the implementation of ClassA, it also contains a 'regular' ClassB, which will not work properly if ClassA has not been constructed yet (which is why I've made ClassA is a static/global).</p>

<p>In Windows, I believe that the DLL loader will load this DLL on the call to ClassB's constructor, correct? At this point, ClassA will be constructed and then ClassB's construction will follow. If a second thread comes along and constructs ClassB, ClassA will not be constructed as it has already been constructed.</p>

<p>Now, my question is -- what if ClassB is constructed simultaneously by two threads. So Thread 1 will start to construct ClassA. Will Thread 2 wait until ClassA is completely constructed before executing ClassB's constructor?</p>

<p>In other words, does LoadLibrary() use a CriticalSection to ensure thread-safe initialization of a DLL's static/globals? My hunch is 'yes', but I can't seem to find any documentation saying one way or the other.</p>

"6168676","<p>I am writing a scriptable game engine, for which I have a large number of classes that perform various tasks. The size of the engine is growing rapidly, and so I thought of splitting the large executable up into dll modules so that only the components that the game writer actually uses can be included. When the user compiles their game (which is to say their script), I want the correct dll's to be part of the final executable. I already have quite a bit of overlay data, so I figured I might be able to store the dll's as part of this block. My question boils down to this:</p>

<p>Is it possible to trick LoadLibrary to start reading the file at a certain offset? That would save me from having to either extract the dll into a temporary file which is not clean, or alternatively scrapping the automatic inclusion of dll's altogether and simply instructing my users to package the dll's along with their games.</p>

<p>Initially I thought of going for the ""load dll from memory"" approach but rejected it on grounds of portability and simply because it seems like such a horrible hack.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

"20076600","<p>I am having some trouble understanding why both #include and LoadLibrary() is needed in C++. In C++ ""#include"" forces the pre-processor to replace the #include line with the contents of the file you are including (usually a header file containing declarations). As far as I understand, this enables me to use the routines I might want in the external libraries the headers belong to.</p>

<p>Why do I then need LoadLibrary()? Can't i just #include the library itself?</p>

<p>Just as a side note: In C#, which I am more familiar with, I just Add a Reference to a DLL if I want to use types or routines from that DLL in my program. I do not have to #include anything, as the .NET framework apparently automatically searches all the referenced assemblies for the routines I want to use (as specified by the namespace)</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

"11100867","<p>I'm having a strange problem with LoadLibrary on Windows.  First some background.  This application depends on Qt, and Qt is split into several libraries.  I am trying to upgrade versions of Qt, but without breaking anyone.  The newer Qt library is backwards compatible with the old one.  That means that an application built with the older version can run if it loads the newer version.  The opposite is not true -- an application built with the newer version will have missing symbols if the older one is loaded.</p>

<p>The Qt DLLs are in version specific directories (say <code>c:\qt\qt-4.5.2\lib</code> and <code>c:\qt\qt-4.8.1\lib</code> as examples).  There is also a common directory that most developers have in their PATH that contains the ""current"" version of all the third party libraries we use (call it <code>c:\common\lib</code>).  This is where the Qt libraries would normally be found when running an application.</p>

<p>I put the new Qt version libraries in the common location, and everything seemed to be working OK, except for one case.  The application in question is split into multiple libraries, some of which are loaded by calling <code>LoadLibrary()</code>.  Some of these runtime loaded DLLs depend on Qt libraries.  In one case, the loaded DLL depends on <code>QtXml</code>, which itself depends on <code>QtCore</code>.</p>

<p>Here's where it gets weird.  An application depends on <code>QtCore</code> and also loads a library that depends on <code>QtXml</code>.  The application and library were built linking with the old version of Qt.  If this application is run with just the common directory in the PATH, everything works because the new Qt version DLLs are loaded from the common directory.  However, if the PATH contains the directory where the old Qt version DLLs are stored <em>before</em> the common directory, then loading the runtime DLL fails with missing symbols.</p>

<p>(This situation arises when doing automated unit testing, with scripts explicitly setting the PATH to use the specific library version.)</p>

<p>As near as I can figure, the application is loading the old version of <code>QtCore.dll</code> and the runtime loaded DLL is (somehow) loading the new version of <code>QtXml.dll</code>, which fails because the already loaded <code>QtCore</code> doesn't have the symbols it needs.</p>

<p>But this seems impossible, since the PATH is something like <code>c:\qt\qt-4.5.2\lib;c:\common\lib</code> (plus other unrelated paths).  If I <em>remove</em> the newer <code>QtXml</code> from the common lib directory (not replace it with the old version, just remove it), then <code>LoadLibrary()</code> succeeds, because it loads the 4.5.2 version of all the Qt libraries.  But that's not a good long term solution, since running without the Qt specific version directory in the PATH (common) will fail to find <code>QtXml</code>.</p>

<p>How could this be?  How could <code>LoadLibrary()</code> (or whatever it calls recursively to resolve the library's dependencies) load a library from <em>later</em> in the <code>PATH</code>?  I cannot find anything that would indicate that the common library directory is given special consideration (it's not a set DLL directory).  It's not mentioned in the build process, it's just something developers have in their <code>PATH</code> for convenience.</p>

<p>btw, a similar situation exists on Linux with <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>dlopen()</code>, and it works just fine there.  This is something Windows is doing differently that I don't understand.  Does anyone have any insight into what could be going wrong?</p>

"2215549","<p>I have to use the gdLibrary (<a href=""http://www.libgd.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.libgd.org</a>) in a C++ App on MS Windows XP Prof. SP3 32bit - and I'm trying and googleing for two days now without success. Does anyone of you use libgd with MS VC++ 200x EE?</p>

<p>My problem: <strong>It <em>has to</em> to compile with MS Visual C++</strong> (e.g. the 2008 Express Edition - fixed 3rd party condition)... but currently the linker crashes, with 11 of the following <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/799kze2z%28VS.80%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LNK2019</a> errors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Linking...
  codereate.obj : error LNK2019: An undefined external symbol ""_gdImageDestroy"" was found in ""public: virtual __thiscall CodeCreate::~CodeCreate(void)""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other smybols are <code>_gdImageColorExact</code>, <code>_gdImageCopyResized</code> and some other gd-functions. It seems that the VC++ linker does not work correctly with the <code>bgd.lib</code> provided by the package I downloaded from <code>http://www.libgd.org/releases/gd-latest-win32.zip</code>.  </p>

<p><strong>What I did/tried:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Extracted <code>gd-latest-win32.zip</code> to <code>c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd</code>.</li>
<li>Defined <code>c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\lib</code> als additional library dir (global VC++ setting)</li>
<li>Defined <code>c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\include</code> as additional includes dir (global VC++ setting)</li>
<li>Defined <code>c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\include\lib\bgd.lib</code> as additional linker\input dependency (project setting)</li>
<li>I even added <code>#pragma comment(lib, ""libgd.lib"")</code> into my <code>codecreate.h</code> to be on the save side.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any suggestions? What am I doing wrong (e.g. have I forget to install something)? Is there any ""trick"" to get a VC++ 2008 compatible <code>bgd.lib</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Running on Linux/g++, everything works fine, no warnings with <code>-pedantic -ansi -wAll</code>. The program does its job an generates some barcodes.</li>
<li>It <strong>works when using DevC++</strong> for Win32. Therefore it is no Windows issue, ""just"" a VC++ issue. For DevC++ I did:

<ul>
<li>I just downloaded <code>http://www.libgd.org/releases/gd-latest-win32.zip</code>,  </li>
<li>extracted it to <code>c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd</code></li>
<li>added <code>c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\lib\bgd.lib</code> as additional obbject in the linker-projects settings.</li>
<li>defined <code>c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\lib</code> als additional library dir,</li>
<li>defined <code>c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\include</code> as additional includes dir</li>

"10506304","<p>I'm working on an ASP.NET web site, developing in Visual Studio 2010.  Most of the site is written in managed code (F# and C#), but it uses an unmanaged DLL (QuickPDF) for some of its functionality.  The site works fine running locally, but when deployed to a hosting provider (aspnethosting.co.uk), the LoadLibrary call fails, returning a handle of IntPtr.Zero.</p>

<p>According to the hosting provider's console, the site is running at a trust level of Full (Internal).  </p>

<p>The DLL is in the web site's bin directory and the hosting provider tells me that it has appropriate permissions.</p>

<p>I've tried using no specific path at all to the DLL, using .\, and also working out what the current assembly path is using Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().CodeBase (see F# code below) - which works fine when running locally.</p>

<p>Anything else I can do to help pin this down?</p>

<p>Here's the F# code which works out the path to the DLL:</p>

<pre><code>let assemblyDirectory =
    let codeBase = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().CodeBase;
    let uri = new UriBuilder(codeBase)
    let path = Uri.UnescapeDataString(uri.Path)
    Path.GetDirectoryName(path)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's where the F# code uses that path (having checked it points to the DLL)</p>

<pre><code>let dllPath = Path.Combine(assemblyDirectory, ""QuickPDFDLL0814.dll"")
if not (File.Exists(dllPath)) then
    failwith (""Could not find QuickPDF DLL at: "" + dllPath)
let lib = QuickPDFDLL0814.PDFLibrary(dllPath)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the C# code where an attempt is made to load the QuickPDF dll - this is where it fails - ie. dllHandle IS equal to IntPtr.Zero.</p>

<pre><code>    public PDFLibrary(string dllFileName)
    {
        dll = new DLL(dllFileName);
        if (dll.dllHandle != IntPtr.Zero)

<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6227426/why-qoci-plugin-isnt-working"">Why QOCI plugin isn&#39;t working</a></p>

<p>However it turned out that it is a library loading issue (at least I think so), so I decided to change the subject of the question since it is a new question.</p>

<p>I have a dll file (called qsqloci4.dll) When I try to load it with LoadLibrary, it fails and GetLastError returns ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND. When I try to load it with LoadLibraryEx and 3rd parameter is DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES, <em>it loads successfully</em> (does not return NULL).</p>

<p>So, i thought it is a dependency issue. I opened the dll file with dependency walker, there were 2 files that couldn't be located: QtCore4.dll and QtSql4.dll.
However, these files are in the working directory of application, and other dll files which are dependent on those dlls (such as qsqlpsql4.dll) are successfully loaded.</p>

<p>Other dlls (which are located by dependency walker) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>oci.dll : is in same folder as QtCore4.dll and QtSql4.dll, means my app can access it</li>
<li>kernel32.dll : i believe the easiest dll to locate by my app</li>
<li>msvscr80.dll : other dll files which use this can be loaded successfully.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is my question: given dependency walker says : ""you have all dlls except qt ones"" and i am sure that I have qt dlls, what other reason can be for LoadLibrary to fail with ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND?</p>

"3272345","<p>I use a class that automatically crops an image as a square based on some options. The problem is that when the image is of a certain width and height, the image is cropped but a 1px column of black pixels is added to the right of the image. I think that the problem is in  the mathematics used to generate the new image size... Maybe when the division of the height and the width gives a decimal number then the square is not perfect and the black pixels are added...</p>

<p>Any solution?</p>

<p>This is how I call the object:</p>

<pre><code>$resizeObj = new resize($image_file); // *** 1) Initialise / load image
            $resizeObj -&gt; resizeImage(182, 182, 'crop'); // *** 2) Resize image
            $resizeObj -&gt; saveImage($destination_path, 92); // *** 3) Save image

        $heightRatio = $this-&gt;height / $newHeight;

            $optimalRatio = $heightRatio;
        } else {
            $optimalRatio = $widthRatio;
        }

        $optimalHeight = $this-&gt;height / $optimalRatio;
        $optimalWidth  = $this-&gt;width  / $optimalRatio;

        return array('optimalWidth' =&gt; $optimalWidth, 'optimalHeight' =&gt; $optimalHeight);
    }

    private function crop($optimalWidth, $optimalHeight, $newWidth, $newHeight)
    {
        // *** Find center - this will be used for the crop
        $cropStartX = ( $optimalWidth / 2) - ( $newWidth /2 );
        $cropStartY = 0; // start crop from top

        $crop = $this-&gt;imageResized;
        //imagedestroy($this-&gt;imageResized);

        // *** Now crop from center to exact requested size

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/809948/dll-references-in-visual-c"">DLL References in Visual C++</a> </p>

<p>and it appears that a DLL cannot be loaded in C++ without the caller also having the <strong>.LIB</strong> file. Is this true that the .lib file is absolutely required if I want to dynamically load a DLL at run-time as follows?</p>

<pre><code>   #include &lt;Windows.h&gt;
    HMODULE h;  
    LPCWSTR l;  
    DWORD error;
    wchar_t *myDLL = L""E:\\...\\myWin32DLL.dll"";

    l = (LPCWSTR)myDLL;
    h = LoadLibrary(l);     
    error = GetLastError();  
</code></pre>

<p>If I call LoadLibrary using the code above, I get the result NULL. The error code from GetLastError() is 193: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms681382%28v=VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT</a>.  Why?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT/UPDATE:</strong>
I figured out what's wrong -- I had the target platform of the program (that calls the DLL) as x64, and once I changed it to Win32, LoadLibrary now returns a non-NULL result.</p>

<p>The DLL is made up of one source file, expFns.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;Windows.h&gt;

#define Pi 3.14159

extern _declspec(dllexport)  
double circumference(double radius)
{
    return 2.0 * radius * Pi;
}
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(
    HINSTANCE hinstDLL,  // handle to DLL module
    DWORD fdwReason,     // reason for calling function
    LPVOID lpReserved )  // reserved
{
    return TRUE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how it is compiled:</p>

<pre><code>cl expFns.cpp /link /DLL /out:mywin32dll.dll
</code></pre>

<p>If I use some well-known DLL such as unrar3.DLL, I still get error code 193. Why am I getting this error code?</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I use P/Invoke in managed C#, all I need is the full path to the .DLL, no .LIB file needed, and the function call to the DLL will work. Why is it necessary in C++ to have the .LIB file, but C# does not need the .LIB file?</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(@""E:\...\myDLL.dll""
            , CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl
            , EntryPoint = ""get_value"")]
internal static extern double get_value(double l, double w, double h);

"7122107","<p>I'm trying to write a cross-platform program in c++ that will load certain modules (shared libraries) at runtime. To do this I'm using the ClassLoader from <a href=""http://www.pocoproject.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Poco C++ Libraries</a>. I've written a compiling chain using autoconf, automake and libtool. This shouldn't be any problem in a Linux environment, but the problem occurs in Windows. I'm using MinGW and MSYS when compiling to be able to make use of my Makefiles. ClassLoader uses the Windows-specific LoadLibrary() function to load the modules, which means I have to compile them as DLLs.</p>

<p>The class that I compile to a library inherits another class within the main application. Then when I try to run make, it complains a lot about undefined reference and refuses to build a shared library. I guess this is because of the name mangling. Or is it because I can't inherit a class outside of the library? (That class is not included in the sources for the library, but the header file is found)</p>

<p>I'm not really sure how much trouble it's going to bring that I insist on compiling under MinGW + MSYS but still make use of LoadLibrary(). Anyone with experience of this?</p>

"15328687","<p>When calling external C library (DLL) from matlab, it seems that matlab will first try to generate a thunk file named as <code>filename_thunk_pcwinXX.dll</code> (where XX is either 32 or 64 depend on the OS) in a temp directory.</p>

<p>In matlab docs, it mentions that this file is an interface between external DLL and Matlab, so it doesnt not contain any other data of the original external DLL.</p>

<p>The problem is, i have written a library that at runtime may call other libraries, matlab will always give me some wierd results or even crash when the library is calling certain libraries (not all, and  my library and other libraries here are 64-bit DLL).</p>

<p>And all my library functions work flawlessly when being called from other C/C++ programs instead of matlab.</p>

<p>I just wonder, in order to let matlab works properly, does these other libraries being called by my library at runtime need to get some sort of thunk file as well? I just cannot believe that, but I dont know the exact method of how matlab handle external libraries either.</p>

"42445614","<p>I'm trying to learn how to use <code>LoadLibrary</code> properly in a <code>C</code> function, but am having difficulty and there are not a lot of good tutorials to follow.  I've created a simple C program that uses the <code>libCurl</code> library to successfully fetch the HTML of a website and print it to console.   I am now trying to re-implement the same function using <code>LoadLibrary</code> and <code>GetProcAddress</code> and the <code>libcurl.dll</code>.</p>

<p>How do I pass data back from a function that is loaded into memory?</p>

<p>Posted below is the function using the .lib that works and subsequently the function trying to use the DLL that is failing to compile.</p>

<p>Here is my working program:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""stdafx.h""
#include ""TestWebService.h""
#include ""curl/curl.h""

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    CURL *curl;
    CURLcode res;

    curl = curl_easy_init();
    if (curl) {

        struct string s;
        init_string(&amp;s);

        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, ""http://example.com"");
        /* example.com is redirected, so we tell libcurl to follow redirection */
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1L);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, writefunc);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &amp;s);

        /* Perform the request, res will get the return code */
        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
        /* Check for errors */
        if (res != CURLE_OK)
            fprintf(stderr, ""curl_easy_perform() failed: %s\n"", curl_easy_strerror(res));

        /* always cleanup */
        printf(""%s\n"", s.ptr);
        free(s.ptr);
        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }

    return 0;

"21915274","<p>I have a problem loading a native library using <code>System.loadLibrary(""my_shared_lib"");</code>
The problem is that this call never returns.</p>

<p><strong>Here is the context :</strong></p>

<p>In my project I have several static libraries built using the nkd-build script.
Building them works well using this <code>Android.mk</code> for each <code>.a</code> lib I need:</p>

<pre><code>**Android.mk used for static libs**

LOCAL_PATH:= $(call my-dir)

include $(CLEAR_VARS)

LOCAL_MODULE    := my_static_lib_1

# Include paths
LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := \
    $(PATH_TO_INCLUDES1) \
    $(PATH_TO_INCLUDES2)

# Sources
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := \
    my_source_1.cpp\
    my_source_11.cpp


# Target
include $(BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>

<p>These static libraries contain of course only native (C++) sources, among with some JNI wrappers (callable from Java sources).</p>

<p>Once all static libraries (<code>.a</code>) are built, I want to build a shared library (<code>.so</code>) containing all the <code>.a</code> libs I need.
Here is the <code>Android.mk</code> I'm using to build this shared library:</p>

<pre><code>LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
#----------
# Static prebuilt libs 
#----------
#-- my_static_lib_1
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE    := my_static_lib_1
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := $(PATH_TO_LIBS)/my_static_lib_1.a
include $(PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY)

#-- my_static_lib_2
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE    := my_static_lib_2
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := $(PATH_TO_LIBS)/my_static_lib_2.a
include $(PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY)

#----------
# Building shared lib
#----------
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := my_shared_lib

#-- Some of the .a static libs need these libs
LOCAL_LDLIBS := \
    -lz\
    -llog \
    $(PATH_TO_NDK_LIBS)\libstlport_static.a

#-- This variable is used to force libs to be included in the .so
LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES := \
    my_static_lib_1\
    my_static_lib_2

include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>

<p>This builds me a perfect <code>.so</code> file, containing all the functions from the <code>.a</code> libs (I could check that using the nm command on the generated <code>.so</code> lib).</p>

<p>And to be complete, here is the <code>.java</code> file dynamically loading the <code>.so</code> lib:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass
{
    static {
        Log.d(""MYLOGS"", ""Loading..."");
        System.loadLibrary(""my_shared_lib"");
        Log.d(""MYLOGS"", ""Loaded."");
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>

<p>When I'm creating a new instance of MyClass, loadLibrary is called, but it never returns. I can see the <code>Loading...</code> log but never the <code>Loaded.</code> one.
The logCat says <code>Trying to load lib [...].so</code> but that's all, the app freezes.</p>

<p>All of this works fine when I have only one static lib <code>.a</code> in my <code>.so</code> file. In that case, I can call my native code perfectly. But my project uses 8 <code>.a</code> files, and I got a freezed app because loadLibrary never ends in that case.</p>

<p>What is wrong with the <code>loadLibrary</code> call ? Do you have any idea ?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

"6283482","<p>Up until now, I had some sort of plugin mechanism in which I loaded dlls using LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress to create a concrete object and return a common interface. This worked fine until I decided that one of the dlls should be an exe.</p>

"48430688","<p>I have an x64 Windows application which sometimes crashes within a DLL library which I unfortunately have no control over. This library is actually a large set of inter-dependent DLLs (~40 of them). The crash isn't always in the same place, but here's an example of what is happening:</p>

<pre><code>Exception thrown at 0x0000018393916B72 (foo.dll) in bar.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x000001831C1F95A0.
</code></pre>

<p>At this location, the disassembly in Visual Studio shows the following:</p>

<pre><code>0000018393916B72  cmp         dword ptr [1831C1F95A0h],3  
</code></pre>

<p>This at first seemed odd to me, since that means the DLL would be hard-coded to load a value at a bad location. So, I took a look at the actual instruction memory and found the following:</p>

<pre><code>83 3d 27 2a 8e 88 03
</code></pre>

<p>Which disassembles exactly to:</p>

<pre><code>cmp    DWORD PTR [rip+0xffffffff888e2a27],0x3
</code></pre>

<p>What's happened here is that an instruction was generated in the DLL which says ""Compare the value located X bytes after this instruction to 3."" This memory resides in a different DLL from this one, and X is a 32-bit value. I assume that the value of X gets patched when that other DLL is loaded.</p>

<p>Looking at the actual bytes of the instruction, it's clear that it wants rip+0x888e2a27, which does point to where one of the DLLs in this library resides, but unfortunately this 32-bit value gets sign extended and it ends up looking backwards in memory instead of forwards.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the root cause is that these DLLs were loaded into memory more than 0x7FFFFFFF bytes from each other, and thus when they try to reference each other with a 32-bit offset, they fail to do so. I'm unsure why the compiler which generated these DLLs opted to use an RIP+32-bit instruction instead of a 64-bit absolute address, but it seems to have done so quite frequently. Possibly a size-saving measure?</p>

<p>Either way, I figure the easiest way to resolve this issue is to force <code>LoadLibrary</code> to load these DLLs next to each other, or at least relatively close to each other. I have tried various way to do this, but it seems Windows is purposefully random and opaque about where it decides to load DLLs.</p>

<p>Is there any way around this problem? Here are my potential solutions, but I don't know how to do any of them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Force <code>LoadLibrary</code> to load the DLLs either at a specific address, or with some kind of option which forces these DLLs to be near each other in memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the DLLs themselves to remove any RIP+(32-bit value) instructions, and replace them with an instruction which supports 64-bit address values.</p></li>
<li><p>If I could potentially get the vendor to recompile the DLLs, have them use a specific compiler flag to prevent these RIP+(32-bit value) instructions from being used. I don't know what this compiler flag would be, however. I assume they used MSVC but I'm not actually sure.</p></li>

"42720820","<p>I am using Dlib thanks to its great matrix sub module. I find it very complete and useful to do fast scientific algorithm. I managed to add some custom operations and get the overall idea how it works. </p>

<p>However, there is a question that bother me since quite some time. Is there specific reason why it seems impossible to assign any kind of matrix expression to an <code>std::vector</code> ?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Here is a typical dlib function:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename EXP&gt;
const matrix_op&lt;op_trans&lt;EXP&gt; &gt; trans(const matrix_exp&lt;EXP&gt;&amp; m) {
  typedef op_trans&lt;EXP&gt; op;
  return matrix_op&lt;op&gt;(op(m.ref());
}
</code></pre>

<p>And if I want to implement the corresponding function that takes and returns <code>std::vector</code> instead, I think I would do:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename EXP&gt;
const std::vector&lt;matrix_op&lt;op_trans&lt;EXP&gt; &gt; &gt; trans(const std::vector&lt;matrix_exp&lt;EXP&gt; &gt;&amp; ms) {
  std::vector&lt;matrix_op&lt;op_trans&lt;EXP&gt; &gt; &gt; out(ms.size());
  typedef op_resize_bilinear&lt;EXP&gt; op;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; ms.size(); ++i)
    out[i] = matrix_op&lt;op&gt;(op(ms.ref()));
  return out;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But as it works, any expression is seen as <code>matrix_exp</code> being <code>matrix</code>, <code>matrix_op</code>, <code>matrix_add_exp</code>... But this is not true with <code>std::vector&lt;matrix_exp&gt;</code>:</p>

<p><code>‘const std::vector&lt;smu::matrix&lt;float&gt; &gt;’ is not derived from ‘const std::vector&lt;smu::matrix_exp&lt;EXP&gt; &gt;’</code></p>

<p>I just want to know if this is intentional from dlib, if there are any reason for it as it could be useful in several algorithms that need to process several matrices at once... and if some work around this could work</p>

"16953513","<p>I have created a site with a custom module built on top of OpenCart. It allows you to design a business card, brochure, or post card online (something like vistaprint but simpler) and generates a print ready file. </p>

<p>One of the requested features was a mail merge type feature for post cards. Basically the customer would create their design, then upload a csv file of the names and addresses they want the document mailed to.</p>

<p>My thought was after the order was placed a script on the server would go through the csv file, and create an image for each row. Basically inserting the mailing address onto the graphic and saving it as a copy. Once it was done with them it would bundle them into a pdf and send the printer a link to download the file.</p>

<p>That will work great if they are sending it to 100 people or less, but if they want to mail it to 10,000 people I don't see it working.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience generating a mass amount of graphics and giant pdfs? If so I would love their advice on how to implement it.</p>

<p>I have full control of the server, and can install or modify any software on it. It is Cent OS, with PHP, MySQL, and the works. I do not have any extra pdf extensions installed as I haven't needed them yet, but I can add them.</p>

<p>Other Notes:</p>

<pre><code>- The resolution will be at 300dpi. Meaning each page of the pdf will be as much as 2,550 x 3,300px
- The final product doesn't have to be a pdf, it just needs to be a single file and printable
- I am currently rendering the graphics as a jpg or png
</code></pre>

<p>I do plan to post the module on OpenCarts extension directory after I have all of it working, so if it suits anyones needs it will be there once it is all working properly.</p>

In case I use the command</p>

<pre><code>LoadLibrary(L""...\\whole path\\B.dll"");
</code></pre>

<p>everything is working fine. But assuming that sometimes the path may change due to maintenance reason for example I came up with</p>

<pre><code>LoadLibraryEx(""B.dll"", NULL, LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_APPLICATION_DIR);
</code></pre>

<p>to allow moving the DLLs without expecting loading problems.</p>

<p>This command is searching in the application's installations directory (see: <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684179(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684179(v=vs.85).aspx</a>).</p>

<p>Using Visual Studio 2010 Express it worked for me when I placed B.dll in the folder where the A.dll is saved.
Some days ago I installed Visual Studio 2015 Express. I placed the B.dll in the corresponding folder. It did not work. I copied it then into every other folder related to my A.dll though B.dll could not be found.</p>

<p>Note, both DLLs have been rewritten in VS2015! It is, thus, not a problem of different VS versions.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea how to fix this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: (former problem understood, related question)</strong>
After reading comments I found out this command redirects my DLL to search in Excels directory (which is calling A.dll).
But what I want to do is:<br/>
VBA will call a DLL A.dll by using an absolute path. All other DLLs like B.dll, C.dll, and so on will be in the same folder as A.dll. But those DLL I want to call giving a relative path. My intention is to change the path only once in the VBA code when I move all DLLs.<br/>
How do I do this?</p>

<p>Let's look at the loss for the same classes (1030 line), I think the gradient of <code>scale*(d2 - (dist_thresh-margin))</code> should be equal to the gradient of <code>C1*(||X1 - X2|| - (C2-C3))</code>, where CN - constant, and XN - output vector, so their gradient should be = <code>C1</code> for X1 and <code>-C1</code> for X2, but instead of this, we get some another calculations on the lines 1031, 1032, 1056. </p>

<p>Same for the gradient for the different classes (starting from 1048 line).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even hint in the first comment does not make it clearer. I don't have enough experience for understanding this, but I think some slightly more experienced person can show where I made a mistake. </p>

<p>I would like to load an opencv image object into face_recognition library.

<p>Here is what something I did:</p>

<pre><code>im_obj = request.data['image_file']
im_cv = cv2.imdecode(np.fromstring(im_obj.read(), np.uint8), cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)
result, checked_cv_image = process(im_cv) &lt;-- this does some stuff like crop, etc

unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(checked_cv_image) &lt;-- this doesnt work

<p>it has this error:</p>

<p>My Question:</p>

<p>I would like to know is it possible to figure a way how to load an opencv object into face_recognition object.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I tried to use, this:</p>

<pre><code>ret, buf_checked_cv_image = cv2.imencode( '.png', checked_cv_image )
unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(buf_checked_cv_image)

"39015782","<p>I am using dlib's <em>train_object_detector</em> for face detection and I have roughly 6k images in a folder with which I am trying to train my model.</p>

<p>Also, I am using dlib's example python code(train_object_detector.py) for this purpose.</p>

<p>But the thing is, the program's RAM usage is insane. For roughly 300 images, it required approximately 15GB RAM and right now with my 6k images, I'm stuck. </p>

<p>For 6k images, while training, it required <strong>more than 100GBs of RAM</strong> and eventually program killed itself.</p>

<p>Has it always been like this? or am I doing something wrong? Is it normal to have this much of RAM usage?</p>

<p>It is almost not modified at all and pretty much same with the example code from dlib.</p>

<p>I checked if %SystemRoot%\System32\hhctrl.ocx  exists on the Windows 7 system and it does. </p>

<p>Why does loading it via LoadLibrary fail? How can I work around this problem?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> GetLastError says (in German, so I am just translating): ""Could not find file."" But I debugged the function and the path is ""%SystemRoot%\System32\hhctrl.ocx"" and the file does exist. </p>

<p>Also, since two answers point in the direction of 64-bit vs 32-bit problems: My application is a 32 bit executable compiled in C++ Builder 5, so it should be a 32 bit process if I'm not mistaken. Or am I wrong to assume that? </p>

"21465145","<p>I'm starting using dlib, and I have hard time understanding the way kernels are implemented. I started with the k-kmeans algorithm as I know this clustering method. However I cannot figure out where the kernel is computed. The input data are a matrix (not a kernel) and the algorithm never transform the data into a kernel.
I would expect a kernel class returning a square matrix. But I have not seen anything like this!
I want to use dlib to implement a clustering algorithm using kernels and dlib sounds a good solution to do so. Does anyone has a documentation on how it is implemented or can explain me how it does work?</p>

"54266099","<p>I've been trying to use ""dlib.train_simple_object_detector"" to make a detector to detect pedestrians. After a few hours of making rectangles in imglab I made the Inria person dataset consisting of about 600 into an xml file.

<p>So I reduce the amount of training images and find that it onlys starts working when there are about 100 images. 
When I try this detector on test images the detection rate is pretty bad so I would really like to train on all the images or atleast on more of them than 100. </p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<p>Is there a way to reduce the ram usage when training with ""dlib.train_simple_object_detector""?</p>

<p>And some more errors too. But I think those errors are because of this error which I have mentioned. </p>

<p>I have windows 10 and python 3.6 . I have installed CMake version 3.11.4</p>

<p>Is there any solution for this ?</p>

<p>I don't get any other error message so I'm not sure what to do to troubleshoot this. I installed boost and python (and symlinked over system python) using homebrew on OS X. I've been searching around and I saw that this is normally caused by incompatible versions of boost and python, which could be caused by using homebrew versions of libraries with system python. I'm fairly certain this is the cause somehow but CMake tells me this when compiling</p>

<pre><code>-- Detecting CXX compile features - done

<p>So I know that thte python libs and boost libs are both coming from the homebrew managed <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and not the system managed <code>/usr/bin/</code>. Make finishes fine and returns a success and even seems to install everything just fine. </p>

"5262552","<p>I have compiled a JNI dll that I would like to load into my Java application using <code>System.loadLibrary</code>. This works perfectly fine on Windows XP with the dll compiled using MSVC++ 2008 Express.</p>

<p>However, on Windows 7, where I compiled the dll using MSVC++ 2010 Express (same options, same processor architecture, same Java version, just different OS and compiler) the application would freeze upon the <code>loadLibrary</code> call. No error messages, no reaction at all. When I try <code>jstack</code> on the frozen process it freezes as well (no output, no termination). Running the application as an administrator does not fix this problem.</p>

<p>The DLL and all its dependencies are in the <code>java.library.path</code>. In fact, when I removed them, the Java application would tell me they're missing, so the dll must have been initialized properly and something else fails. Debugging proves, however, that it's actually <code>loadLibrary</code> freezing and nothing afterwards.</p>

<p>Can anybody tell me what might be going on here?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>

<p>As stated in my comment below, this problem seems to go deeper. Using a simple C program to load one of the dependencies of said DLL already makes the freeze occur, so this must be some kind of problem with the Windows API and how MSVC++ linked the DLL (that dependency was linked by MSVC++ 2010 Express as well).</p>

<p>Reading the comment's user, seems to be an union problem for MATLAB exceptions (<a href=""https://es.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/limitations-to-shared-library-support.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://es.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/limitations-to-shared-library-support.html</a>) working with C++. I don't know so much about C++ languaje. </p>

<p>I tried to edit the header files like in the following example. Replace this piece of code for one of the headers:</p>

<pre><code>#define LC_ACT_KWH 14
typedef union taguLC_ACT {   /* 14/IDT */
int m_id;
typeCDB_LC_ACT m_lc_act;
} typeuLC_ACT;
</code></pre>

<p>For this:</p>

<pre><code>#define LC_ACT_KWH 14
typedef struct taguLC_ACT {   /* 14/IDT */
int m_id;
typeCDB_LC_ACT m_lc_act;
} typeuLC_ACT;
</code></pre>

<p>but it doesn't work...</p>

"45813877","<p>I have a large face dataset (10k training, 5k validation images) with an image size of 5184x3456 and two XML files describing the training and validations sets (in dlib format, see below). I would like to train a deep neural network on this dataset for face detection using dlib. With the current image size, the training takes too much memory and time. Therefore, I would like to rescale the whole dataset. </p>

<p>Rescaling the images are easily achieved by using ImageMagick <a href=""https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">convert</a>; however, of course I also need to change the pixel coordinates of the ground truth face boxes in my training and validation XML files appropriately so that the face boxes still fall on faces on the new, rescaled images. Those files have the following structure:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;image file=""00056475158675a7f26160c17b6643bb.jpg""&gt;
  &lt;box width=""294"" top=""1245"" height=""354"" left=""753""/&gt;

  &lt;box width=""282"" top=""1029"" height=""402"" left=""225""/&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to quickly rescale the box attributes (width, height, top, left) using dlib, or perhaps <a href=""https://github.com/davisking/dlib/tree/master/tools/imglab"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">imglab</a>? Thanks.</p>

"49358842","<p>I have a dll and a test application written in Delphi. The test application uses multiple threads to call the function exported by the dll. The exported function has a trivial thread safe implementation. When running the test application various errors (access violation, invalid pointer operation, stack overflow etc) happens or the application freezes. In some cases the application finishes without errors.</p>

<p>Note that these errors only happen (surface) when using multiple threads. When calling the function from the main thread only then everything works fine.</p>

<p>I have found that adding ShareMem to both the dll and the application stops all these kind of errors. But I don't understand why. To my knowledge ShareMem is only needed when passing long strings between the dll and the application. As far as I know WideString is not a long string.</p>

<p>Also according to this post ShareMem should not be required:

<p>Why ShareMem makes the bugs go away and is there another way to fix these bugs?</p>

<p>I am using Delphi XE2 and OmniThread 3.07.5.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
 - Same issue when run from a VCL application's button's on click event handler
 - If DoSomething uses a critical section inside then runs fine
 - If FText field is removed from TMyClass then no errors are reported but the application randomly freezes</p>

To the case: </p>

<p>I properly installed Visual studio and configured dlib properly
Also I have xml file with 194 points landmarks from helen database (about 2300 images mapped in total).</p>

<p>By default the dlib solution is based on face data set that are related to 68 face landmarks and I simply don't know how to expand the limitation from 68 to 194.</p>

<p>When I tried the best what I got that far are 68 points mapped on 194 points data set per image...</p>

<p>By reverse engineering I have found that in render_face_detections.h file there are limitations but even when I changed them from 68 to 194 I have still same output which displays only 68 landmark point on the analyzed image.</p>

<p>Is there a ""correct"" approach to filtering through hough space in DLIB?</p>

<p>UPDATE:
As Davis King pointed, I swapped the coordinates (row, col) vs (x, y) which solved the immediate problem, but the core issue is still there.
My hough space looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4eNrv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4eNrv.jpg"" alt=""Hough Image in color for clarity""></a></p>

<p>As can be seen, there's a number of local maxima, but everything gets dominated by the huge blob in the middle. My initial idea was that every blurry area can be reduced to a single most dominant point</p>

<p>I was thinking about clustering every blob of points above certain threshold, but looping through the entire image to find such points AND feeding points found to the clustering algorithm will be very inefficient so there must be a smarter way, perhaps the inner edges of the image itself could be suppressed (small objects like irregular clutter)?</p>

"49844369","<p>I am trying to install dlib on my raspberry py for a computer vision project with opencv. I installed successfully opencv, and I can import cv2 module in python.</p>

<pre><code>    $ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import cv2
&gt;&gt;&gt; cv2.__version__
'3.3.0'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I installed 2 modules with pip install: dlib and imutils. I can see them in pip freeze:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip freeze | grep dlib
dlib==19.10.0
$ pip freeze | grep imutils
imutils==0.4.6
</code></pre>

<p>But the problem is that in python i can't import them, python does not find them and I can't use them. </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dlib
Traceback (most recent call last):

"30902357","<p>I'm using the following lib for creating ftp server called <a href=""http://pythonhosted.org/pyftpdlib/tutorial.html#building-a-base-ftp-server"" rel=""nofollow"">pyftpdlib</a>.<br>
Following the exact example of building a base ftp server apart of the fact that I've created my own custom handler and passing it as in the example.</p>

<p><strong>First question:</strong>
I need to be able to poll every 50 seconds on a static dictionary (class variable) defined in the custom handler. After each interval of 50 seconds I need to check for some condition and act accordingly.</p>

<p>As you probably see ,the custom handler is being used by the FTP server, I guess I need some working thread that will be able poll on the custom handler's static dictionary every 50 seconds, how do I launch another thread that will be bound to the custom handler and do that kind of timer polling?</p>

<p><strong>Second question</strong>: Is there some way to know that a time of 50 seconds has been passed (on the second it passed) since a specific timestamp which was read from the static dict - I mean to do that without polling every X seconds to check if time has passed, which can be inaccurate.</p>

"13142801","<p>I've been looking at some hooking code which selectively loads a library into certain processes and then hooks certain native API functions (using Detours).  The chain of events looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kernel driver loads <strong>A.dll</strong> into every process.</li>
<li><strong>A.dll</strong>::<code>DllMain()</code> decides whether to load <strong>B.dll</strong> (<code>LoadLibraryEx</code>) which contains actual Detours hooks.</li>
<li><strong>B.dll</strong> runs for the duration of the process hooking said functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second bullet here appears to break the DllMain rules specified <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg487379.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, but I'm trying to work out if the way the driver loads <code>A.dll</code> works around the limitations.  Specifically, the kernel driver uses <code>PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine</code> to get notifications when each process starts and then queues an APC to call <code>LoadLibraryEx</code> on <code>A.dll</code> which means it's pretty much the first DLL loaded when the process starts.  Does this circumvent the problems with calling <code>LoadLibrary</code> within <code>DllMain</code>?</p>

<p>If I run <code>setup.py</code> using the option <code>--yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS</code> I don't get any message about using CUDA. I run it like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo python3.5 setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know what does it cause when I use that flag, I am not sure if it disable compiling it using CUDA or not! </p>

<p>Does anyone has an idea why it succeeds to find CUDA when building Dlib and fails when I want to Compile Dlib's Python Interface? </p>

<p>I have tried to compile Dlib's Python Interface using Cmake as suggested here <a href=""http://dlib.net/compile.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Installation guide by dlib.net</a>, but it fails too! </p>

<p><strong>EDIT1</strong></p>

<p>I run <code>sudo python3.5 setup.py install --clean</code></p>

"14915411","<p><strong>Question:</strong>
I'd like to know if I would need to ask for specific permissions and/or do something extra to make it ""trustworthy"" in case my program copies a dll file multiple times to the temp directory. If I do this, would the program be picked up as malicious software by anti-viruses?</p>

<p><strong>Sample Code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>if (needANewCopyOfTheDll)
{
    string fileName = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + "".dll"";
    // Here, copy my dll to the new file.
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But why?</strong> I have a static library written in C++, and it has global variables, initialization procedures, and so many other stuff. I'd like to have different instances of that library and I can only load the same dll once in the memory. Thus I was thinking of wrapping the library in an instance class, and when I needed a new instance of it just copy the dll file to the temp directory and get a new handle for it using <code>LoadLibrary()</code> function in kernel32.dll</p>

<p>Next to that, I went in my project (a console project), and I pointed to header and lib (release and debug). Note that this project only contain a Main.cpp that call different function from my own other project libs and that main also call the face landmarks detection from dlib.</p>

<p>So, I have no issue to compile my project in Release with the dlib.lib that I created. But when using the <strong>debug dlib.lib</strong> and try to launch my own project in debug mode, I obtain the following error :</p>

When executed on a win7 64 bit system it would fail to load. On the xp machine, the dll files could be in same directory as class files, however in order to not get a unsatisfied link error, i had to copy the files into the system32 folder. Then it gave an error stating that a 32bit dll cannot be loaded on a 64 bit process. I downloaded the 32 bit jdk and set the jdk in the project to load the 32 bit jdk. When that was complete i again got an Unsatisfied link error, and the files are still in system32 as well as next to the class files.

"12589461","<p>I have a working program that loads plugins with <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684175%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>LoadLibrary</code></a>.</p>

<p>New requirement: at some point in the code, I'm given a pointer, and I need to test whether this pointer points into the code or static data of a plugin.</p>

<pre><code>bool is_pointer_into_plugin(void *p, HMODULE h);
</code></pre>

<p>Equivalently, I need to retrieve the plugin into which a pointer points, if any. I also need to know if the pointer points into the main program's code or static data (and ideally, distinguish between read-only and read-write areas).</p>

<pre><code>HMODULE plugin_containing_pointer(void *p);
</code></pre>

<p>Equivalently, I need to be able to retrieve the extent (address and size) at which a plugin is mapped. I also need this information for the main program.</p>

<p>How can I implement <code>is_pointer_into_plugin</code>, or <code>plugin_containing_pointer</code>, or something equivalent?</p>

<p>I can change the call to <code>LoadLibrary</code> if necessary. The lookup should be reasonably fast as possible, the load-time code doesn't need to be fast. Running the plugins in separate processes and communicating through shared memory is not an option. The program must run on Windows XP and up (and Linux, but that's <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12589443/address-range-of-a-dynamically-loaded-library-under-linux"">another question</a>).</p>

<p>The information I need is more or less what the Sysinternals utility <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896656.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>listdlls</code></a> reports, so I tried to find out how it's implemented. I saw a <a href=""http://forum.sysinternals.com/listdlls-functionality-or-source-code_topic21678.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">suggestion</a> of using <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684280%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>NtQueryInformationProcess</code></a> to retrieve a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa813706%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>PEB</code></a> structure which links to a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa813708%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY</code></a>. Looks promising, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can see a <code>DllBase</code> which looks like it might be the starting address of each DLL (is it?), but no size.</li>
<li>The documentation of <code>NtQueryInformationProcess</code> marks it as unportable, but doesn't suggest an alternative for what I'm trying to do.</li>
<li>On my system, the only fields in <code>PEB</code> are <code>BeingDebugged</code> and <code>SessionId</code>, plus some <code>Reserved<em>N</em></code> byte arrays — not a good sign.</li>
</ul>

<p>How can I enumerate the address range of the plugins, or test whether a pointer is within a plugin, or determine which plugin a pointer points into?</p>

<p>The script is called faceripper9000 (based on <a href=""https://github.com/Tyrannosaurus1234/GetFaces"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GetFaces</a>), and it's supposed to take a directory full of MP4s, and a photo of a target person, then output every frame where they appear in the clips.</p>

<p>You can see the script <a href=""https://github.com/MotorCityCobra/face_ripper_9000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, but I'll add it to the bottom of this post too.</p>

<p>Dependancies are numpy, opencv, dlib and face_recognition, all of which appear to be installed correctly, but when the rest of us run the script we're getting this message: </p>

<p>We can get around that by replacing <code>print (""Target image loaded"" + target_image)</code> with <code>print (""Target image loaded"" + str(target_image))</code> but when we run it again, the script starts loading the target image and then halts a few lines later after printing out arrays of numbers like this:</p>

<p>There are a succession of very similar warnings after this.  Somehow or another including both libraries interferes with the template substitution on the part of the one library. So any help will be a greatly appreciated. Thank-you in advance. </p>

"4831858","<p>Basically, when our software runs under <code>Windows 7</code>, it works: the call to <code>LoadLibrary()</code> succeeds, and life is good.  </p>

<p>But when the same software is run on an <code>XP</code> box (latest patches), the call to <code>LoadLibrary</code> fails, returning <code>NULL</code>, with an error code that specifies <code>module not found</code>.  </p>

<p>I have tried forcing it to use the <code>UNICODE</code> version <code>LoadLibraryW</code> instead of the <code>LoadLibraryA</code> version for our app.  </p>

<p>I have tried making sure that the install folders are mapped through a local drive letter.  </p>

<p>And I've verified the pathname is in fact accessible from the executing machine (i.e. the error produced indicates what path it is trying to load, and I use that string to actually find the file).  </p>

<p>The weird thing is that this code runs correctly when compiled on <code>VS 2008 SP2</code>.  </p>

<p>It also works fine when the client machine is <code>Windows 7</code>.  </p>

<p>It only fails if it is compiled + linked by <code>VS 2010</code> and if it run on an <code>XP</code> client.  </p>

<p>I'm at a total loss as to what in the world could be going wrong.  </p>

<p>To add weirdness to the stew:  </p>

<p>If I fire up my <code>XP</code> <code>VM</code> on my development box and run this code in debug build in <code>VS2010</code> under <code>XP</code>, it works correctly!  </p>

<p>In fact, under my <code>XP</code> <code>VM</code>, the standard (release) build also runs correctly!!!  </p>

<p>It's just when run from a true <code>XP</code> box that it fails (I've tried a couple of <code>XP</code> machines so far, both fully patched).  </p>

<p>but when the matrix entries are outputted some rows sum to greater than 100% and some less. I'm sure its something simple but I've been staring at it for ages with no clue. any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>Im not sure why but the multiple <code>cout</code> I was using affected the return value.</p>

<p>The problem was solved by including the debugging <code>cout</code> in a for loop like this:</p>

<pre><code>for (unsigned int m = 0; m &lt; 7; m++)
{
    for (unsigned int n = 0; n &lt; 7; n++)
    {
        confMat[m][n] = confMat[m][n] * 100 / exCount[m];
        cout &lt;&lt; confMat[m][n] &lt;&lt; "" "";
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone does know why?</p>

"4081376","<p>I encounter an access violation when calling a DLL inside LabVIEW. Let's call the DLL ""extcode.dll"". I don't have its code, it comes from an external manufacturer.</p>

<p>Note that dependencies of extcode.dll are loaded before access violation.</p>

<p>The situation is random, but when it happens all subsequent tries lead to it. </p>

<p>The code is a simple LabVIEW function calling a function in the DLL, and prototype is super simple (<code>int function(void)</code>) so it cannot be an misconfiguration of the call parameters, nor pointer arithmetics. I checked every combination of calling conventions and error checking levels.</p>

<p>The DLL runs perfectly fine when called in other environments (.NET and C).</p>

<p>I found that <code>RtlFindClearBitsAndSet</code> is related to bit array manipulations</p>

<p>What does it make you think about? Do you think it is a problem in extcode.dll, LabVIEW, or Windows?</p>

<p>PS: I use LabVIEW 2010 64 bit, on Windows 7 64 bit (and extcode.dll is 64 bit). I didn't manage to reproduce it on 32 bit system.</p>

<p><strong>11/18 EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I ended up making a standalone exe that wraps the DLL; LabVIEW communicates with it through pipes. It works perfectly, but I stil don't understand why loading a DLL into LabVIEW can crash.</p>

These below are the results i.e. 68 facial landmarks that you get on applying the DLib's Facial Landmarks model that can be found <a href=""http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.<br>

<p>It mentions in this <a href=""http://dlib.net/face_landmark_detection.py.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">script</a> that the models was trained on the on the <a href=""https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/facial-point-annotations/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iBUG 300-W</a> face landmark dataset.</p>

<p>Now, I wish to create a similar model for mapping the hand's landmarks. I have the <a href=""https://www.mutah.edu.jo/biometrix/hand-images-databases.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hand dataset</a> here. </p>

<p>What I don't get is:<br>
1. how am I supposed to train the model on those positions? Would I have to manually mark each joint in every single image or is there an optimised way for this?<br>
2. In DLib's model, each facial landmark position has a particular value for e.g., the right eyebrows are 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 respectively. At what point would they have been given those values?<br>
3. Would training those images on DLib's shape predictor <a href=""http://dlib.net/train_shape_predictor.py.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">training script</a> suffice or would I have to train the model on other frameworks (like Tensorflow + Keras) too?</p>

<p>And then , in a function , we are trying to run a function from a DLL in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>LPCWSTR DllFileName;    //Path to the dll stored here
LPCSTR _FunctionName;   // (mangled) name of the function I want to test

MyFunctionPointer functionPointer;

HINSTANCE hInstLibrary = LoadLibrary( DllFileName );

functionPointer = (MyFunctionPointer) functionAddress;

//The values are arbitrary
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int result = 0;

result = functionPointer( a, b );  //Possible error?
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, that there isn't any way of knowing if the functon whose address we got with LoadLibrary takes two integer arguments.The dll name is provided by the user at runtime, then the names of the exported functions are listed and the user selects the one to test ( again, at runtime :S:S ).
So, by doing the function call in the last line, aren't we opening the door to possible stack corruption? I know that this compiles, but what sort of run-time error is going to occur in the case that we are passing wrong arguments to the function we are pointing to?</p>

#define EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
#endif

extern ""C"" {
    EXPORT int dummy() {
        return 5;
    }
}

<p>Now, I don't get any message error, the script run, but it stopped and get crashed. I know the problem in reading the image, because it printed the message before this step, as soon as reach the reading image, it will print some part of it and crashed. I'm sure all paths are correct and the evidence it reads and print some part of image and cannot return NonType Object error, It gives window message of check online solution or stop the program and when I checked online solution, it cannot give me any result. the message as follow:</p>

<p>Unfortunately these errors are in German as I use german software. The (looslely) translation is, that there are links to non-solvable external symbols in different functions. If you know how to change the language to English, I can give you the exact output.</p>

<p>As I googled, I found out, that all functions I tried were from standard libraries, I just found some of the rundll32.dll but maybe there are other links as well.</p>

<p>In fact it seems, that the compiler is not able to access the default windows dll (or the sdk).</p>

<p>Can you tell me what's going wrong here?</p>

<p>PS: For those who understand the German language see <a href=""http://www.gomatlab.de/viewtopic,p,91154.html#91154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gomatlab.de/viewtopic,p,91154.html#91154</a> I posted on a pure matlab forum fist, but as I guess it's a VC++ problem I also posted here.</p>

<p>I am trying to split the five level cascade in the dlib frontal face detector to three level (front, front looking but rotated left, and front looking but rotated right one)</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/3209505/evgeniy"">Evgeniy</a> suggested to split the detector in C++. I am not familiar with C++. When I look into <a href=""https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/dlib/image_processing/frontal_face_detector.h"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">frontal_face_detector.h</a>, <code>get_serialized_frontal_faces</code> returns a base64 encoded object. </p>

<p>I learned how to save a existing detector into a <code>.svm</code> file:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;dlib/image_processing/frontal_face_detector.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace dlib;
using namespace std;

int main()
{   
    frontal_face_detector detector = get_frontal_face_detector(); 

    dlib::serialize(""new_detector.svm"") &lt;&lt; detector;  

    std::cout&lt;&lt;""End of the Program""&lt;&lt;endl;
    return 0;   
}
</code></pre>

<p>So how to split the cascade and save the new detector to a <code>.svm</code> file?</p>

<p>Also will the detector performance increase by reducing the pyramid level from &lt;6> to a lower value in <a href=""https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/dlib/image_processing/frontal_face_detector.h"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">frontal_face_detector.h</a>?</p>

<p>(See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2057923/how-to-check-a-png-for-grayscale-alpha-color-type"">How to check a PNG for grayscale/alpha color type?</a> for details)</p>

<p>I tried <code>imagefilter($im, IMG_FILTER_GRAYSCALE);</code> as well as <code>imagetruecolortopalette($im, false, 255);</code> but all I get are either RGB grayscale images (color type 2) or RGB palette images with a grayscale palette (color type 3). I also tried to initialize the image with <code>imagecreate()</code> instead of <code>imagecreatetruecolor()</code> but again this only leads to a palette image.</p>

<p>Is there any way to create a color type 0 grayscale PNG with PHP's GD functions (or any other functions in PHP)?</p>

<p>Here are some samples of different grayscale images to show what I mean. They all look the same, but if you open them in PhotoShop and look at the Image -> Mode setting, you see the difference. Also a hex editor will reveal the difference in the 26th byte:</p>

<p>Here is the basic code that I use to create the PNGs. Commented lines are alternatives that I have tried:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>DLL_1 should load DLL_x transparently wrt. to it's client code, and it should to load DLL_x dynamically. Now, the loading can be done lazily, so that the <code>LoadLibrary</code> call needn't reside in the <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code> part of DLL_1.</p>

So I go to Configuration Manager, and under Active solution platform, my only choices are Win32, New and Edit. So I click New, type in ""x86"" under ""Type or select the new platform"", and click ""Copy settings from"" to select ""Any CPU"" or something suitable, but my only choice is Win32, and ! I figured maybe it was because I was already targeting .net, so to test that theory, I started a new project, this time as a Win32 Console App. Even under that type of project, my only choice is Win32. The x86, x64, Any CPU, and Itanium that I've heard about don't exist in my VS2008!</p>

<p>So I'm at a loss here. How do I force VS to compile my exe as x86 so that I can use the mapi interface? Or is there a 64-bit version of OLMAPI32.DLL that I can use? How the heck do I get MAPI working in my code if there's no 64-bit library for it and VS gives me the dear-in-the-headlights when I try to set up my environment for x86? I just can't believe that my 64-bit environment automatically disqualifies me from using MAPI.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"52121623","<p>I've dynamically linked <strong>libhunspell.dll</strong> (HunSpell) to my application. It works, but there is a dumb problem which I don't know why it happens.</p>

<p>Even before I use <code>LoadLibrary(""path\\to\\libhunspell.dll"");</code> to load it and use it, on the start of the application it attempts to load the library by itself. If I place the <strong>libhunspell.dll</strong> into the path where my main executable resides, it can load it, otherwise it reports an error, immediately after starting the application - <strong>This application has failed to start because LIBHUNSPELL.DLL was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.</strong> and the application doesn't start.</p>

<p>I would understand if the <code>LoadLibrary</code> would use invalid path but this happens as soon as the executable runs, even before the first statement in <code>WINAPI _tWinMain(HINSTANCE, HINSTANCE, LPTSTR, int)</code> executes (I've tried to place a breakpoint and it doesn't even reach it, so this happens before).</p>

<p>So, as a result, I must place <strong>libhunspell.dll</strong> in the same folder as my application executable, and not in the path I want.</p>

<p>This is probably easy to fix although I don't what to look for.</p>

<p><strong>So the question is - how do I avoid it loading it immediately and have it wait until I use <code>LoadLibrary</code> call?</strong></p>

<p>Here is how I linked if it can help:</p>

<p>1) compiled libhunspell.dll in Visual Studio 2015 (I used /MT option to link it statically so it doesn't have VC++ Redistributable as a dependency).</p>

<p>2) created import library (libhunspell.lib) using <code>implib.exe -a -c -f libhunspell.lib libhunspell.dll</code></p>

<p>3) linked that to the source .cpp unit which is using it using <code>#pragma comment(lib, ""libhunspell.lib"")</code> (it is RAD Studio 2010 so the .lib is required unlike newer versions).</p>

<p>4) later in the same .cpp used <code>LoadLibrary</code> to load this library and used it.</p>

<p>I also understood that it's due to the coords of the landmarks, not due to size of image, because result are same for the same hardcoded landmarks while sizes of this image are different.</p>

<p>P.S. also, I want to note this problem has very nondeterministic behaviour - now all ok with 298x298, but I get wrong result with 297x297 size.</p>

<p>My question is, should this be a separate persistent variable for each instance of the task?</p>

<p>For example: if I launched the same task from within a loop, would each previous instance would be overwritten by the new and therefore would I need an array of instances?</p>

<p>The examples I have seen seem to use a single variable for all instances created but this seem wrong.</p>

<p>Can anyone shed any light?</p>

<p>I setup a virtual env named as <code>menpo</code> to run <code>menpoproject</code>. For a long time I was using <code>load_dlib_frontal_face_detector</code> smoothly. After tinkering with a <code>pip-install dlib</code> command accidentally on virtualenv (I mean via Anaconda Prompt <code>menpo</code>) , I couldn't get my code working due to an ""ImportError"" <code>ImportError: cannot import name' load_dlib_frontal_face_detector'</code>. Code is like below:</p>

<pre><code>import cv2
import menpo.io as mio
import menpodetect
</code></pre>

<p>Throws error at line 3.
There is this guy seems to had a similar issue.
<a href=""https://github.com/menpo/menpodetect/issues/15"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/menpo/menpodetect/issues/15</a></p>

<p>I did all the </p>

<pre><code>conda remove dlib -y
pip uninstall dlib
conda install -c conda-forge dlib
</code></pre>

<p>stuff but still got the same error. Besides that; </p>

<p>Uninstalled Anaconda completely</p>

<p>Removed all Python folders wherever I found.</p>

<p>Installed Anaconda and setup a new menpo virtual env and still no luck. It seems like this dlib installation I made causing some issues. BTW, <code>conda list</code> produces <code>dlib 18.18 py35_2 menpo</code> and there is no <code>pip</code> line as mentioned in the link given above.   </p>

"17435710","<p>I have a MFC DLL. When it initializes it uses LoadLibrary on another library. When my destructor is called it calls FreeLibrary. The MFC dll is a OPOS Service Object (SO). That being said I made a simple C# program that uses OPOS to talk to the SO. It was reported that when a user uses the OPOS command Close() it will sometimes Crash(Windows 7) or just disappear (Windows XP). We've affectionately called this error Close on Close. It has been a major thorn in my neck. Although I've been working on this SO for about a year I will admit that my C++ debugging skills are sorely lacking. I'm more of a C# guy. Now i'm not sure if it is because I'm now using VS2013 preview or if VS2010 and VS2012 just didn't have a good debugger for C++ programs, or if I just didn't understand what I was looking at (I'd vouch for the second) anywho. The debugger points to a function from that Library that is loaded. It happens to be the same function almost every time, but I would think that I would get this error for any of the functions in that library. So I am completely at a loss for how to narrow down what is causing this to happen. It doesn't do it everytime.</p>

<p>I know this code wont help much. But well... I don't know where else to look. So this code works. It is the code that is used to LoadLibrary</p>

<pre><code>#define INITPROCADDR(dllIns,funcName) (FARPROC&amp;)funcName = GetProcAddress(dllIns,#funcName);\
    if(NULL==funcName){\
    CString szMsg;\
    szMsg.Format(_T(""Function: %s can't be found.""),#funcName);\
    AfxMessageBox(szMsg);\
    FreeLibrary(dllIns);\
    return FALSE;\
}
BOOL MasterRD_Load_rfLib(HINSTANCE *phInstMaster)
{
        CString strDll;
        LPTSTR szBuf = strDll.GetBuffer(MAX_PATH);
    GetModuleFileName(AfxGetInstanceHandle(), szBuf, MAX_PATH);
        strDll.ReleaseBuffer();
        strDll = strDll.Left(strDll.ReverseFind('\\') + 1);

    strDll += _T(""\\MasterRD.Dll"");

    *phInstMaster = LoadLibrary(strDll);         
    if(!(*phInstMaster))
    {
        AfxMessageBox(_T(""Can't load MasterRD.dll!""));
        exit(0);
        return FALSE;
    }

    INITPROCADDR((*phInstMaster), rf_GetVer);
    INITPROCADDR((*phInstMaster), rf_DES_Encrypt);
    //Load rest of the functions
}
</code></pre>

<p>and this is how it is used when the Service Object is instantiated</p>

<pre><code>private:
    HINSTANCE  m_hMasterRD;

    if (!MasterRD_Load_rfLib(&amp;m_hMasterRD))
    {
        m_hMasterRD = NULL;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So on close not much happens. I have a background thread that is running that gets shutdown. That background thread uses the MasterRD heavily. That being said on close I do this</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;100; i++)
{
    GetExitCodeThread(ReaderThread, &amp;exitStatus);
    if(exitStatus==3)
        break;

    Sleep(10);
}
CloseHandle(ReaderThread);
ReaderThread = NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>Now my program doesn't always crash, but when it does crash it always crashes on close. And is currently always on a reference to one of the functions in MasterRD. So... i dunno. How do I find out why my reference to that library occasionaly just goes away. I suppose it could be that library but I dont know enough about how C++ works to verify this. Thoughts?</p>

"42604218","<p>I've set up a simple FTP server with pyftpdlib and a client with ftplib. When i let the client script run, it uploads the file correctly as expected.</p>

<h2>pyftpdlib Server code:</h2>

<pre><code>import logging
from pyftpdlib.handlers import FTPHandler
from pyftpdlib.servers import FTPServer
from pyftpdlib.authorizers import DummyAuthorizer

authorizer = DummyAuthorizer()
authorizer.add_user(""test"",""123"",""C:\\Users\\Usr\\Desktop\\server_data"",""elradfmwM"")
handler = FTPHandler
handler.authorizer = authorizer
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
connection = (""localhost"", 8080)
ftpd = FTPServer(connection, handler)
ftpd.serve_forever()
</code></pre>

<h2>ftplib Client code #1:</h2>

<pre><code>import ftplib

ftp = ftplib.FTP()
ftp.connect(""localhost"",8080)
ftp.login(""test"",""123"")

block_size = 128
c_dir = ""C:\\Users\\Usr\\Desktop\\client_data""
filename = ""test.pdf"" # ~ 30Mb

ftp.dir()
myfile = open(c_dir + ""\\"" + filename , ""rb"")

ftp.storbinary(""STOR "" + filename, myfile, blocksize=block_size)

ftp.dir()
ftp.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Now i wanted to test the <code>REST</code> (restart upload/download from a specific position) functionality. So i interrupted the client code while still uploading (simply by closing my command prompt while it was uploading). Next, while the server was still running, i ran the following client code in an attempt to resume the upload from the interrupted position:</p>

<h2>ftplib Client code #2:</h2>

<pre><code>import ftplib

ftp = ftplib.FTP()
ftp.connect(""localhost"",8080)
ftp.login(""test"",""123"")

block_size = 128
c_dir = ""C:\\Users\\Usr\\Desktop\\client_data""
filename = ""test.pdf"" # ~ 30Mb

ftp.dir()
myfile = open(c_dir + ""\\"" + filename , ""rb"")

ftp.voidcmd('TYPE I')
rest_pos = ftp.size(filename)
print(rest_pos)
ftp.storbinary(""STOR "" + filename, myfile, blocksize=block_size, rest=rest_pos)

ftp.dir()
ftp.close()
</code></pre>

<p>When i run client code #2 it does upload but it seems it doesn't start at the correct position. </p>

<p>The file size is ca. 30 Mb</p>

<p>Client code #1 uploads correctly (ca 30Mb)</p>

<p>Client code #2 uploads but the file is larger and corrupted (ca 35Mb)</p>

<p>I've compared the output of <code>rest_pos</code> with the file size under Windows after interrupting and they do match. So the position <code>rest</code> i'm passing to <code>ftp.storbinary</code> is the same as under Windows.</p>

<p>I'm fairly new to python and ftp and cant figure out what the issue is. Googled, but couldn't find anything similar. </p>

<p>Any tips/hints would be appreciated :) </p>

    # start ftp server
    server.serve_forever()

    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever I call this code, it keeps the command line busy with running the ""server.serve_forever()"", it doesn't keep running through the if loop. </p>

<p><strong>So my question is, how do you add a user while the server is running without shutting down the server?</strong> </p>

<p>Do I need to create another script to call this one and then another to add a user? Will it need to be threaded so both can run without locking up on this one?</p>

<p>I've tried to look through the tutorials on this module, but I haven't found any examples or seen any solutions. I'm willing to switch to a different module to run a FTP server if needed, so long as I can control everything. </p>

<p>I'm going to be adding users a lot from a database, then removing them. So I don't want to take the server down and restart it every time I need to add someone.</p>

    shape = predictor(image, d)
    shape = shape_to_np(shape)
    for (x, y) in shape:

        font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX
        #cv2.putText(image,str(one),(x,y), font, .4,(255,255,255),1,cv2.LINE_AA)
        one = one + 1
        cv2.circle(image, (x, y), 1, (0, 0, 255), -1)
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like the entire thing to be identifiable however, so that i can output the ""nose"" text on the image alongside the identifying dots.</p>

<p>In essence, i'd like to be able to assign the word Nose to the set of dots that make up the nose. Easy?</p>

<p>I need to save a PPM file with the resulting image of a transformation using dlib.</p>

<p>I know the resulting image from dlib is fine, because I can save it as png and open it for a visual checking.</p>

<p>I think the problem is when I try to convert it to an unsigned char pointer, to use it in the written process of the ppm file. The resulting image is not as expected. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>I have already tried different types of casting, like static_cast, reinterpret_cast. I have tried different functions like ofstream::write and also access directly the memory.</p>

<pre><code>dlib::array2d&lt;dlib::rgb_pixel&gt; warped_image;
warped_image.set_size(h,w);
dlib::assign_all_pixels(warped_image, 0);
dlib::transform_image(
    original_image, 
    warped_image,
    dlib::interpolate_bilinear(),
    transformation_matrix);

// get warp image after transformation
unsigned char *warped = new unsigned char[h * w * chs];
unsigned char *pt = warped;

// iterate over rows
for (int row=0; row&lt;h; row++) {
    // iterate over cols
    for (int col=0; col&lt;w; col++) { 
        *(pt++) = warped_image[row][col].red;
        *(pt++) = warped_image[row][col].green;
        *(pt++) = warped_image[row][col].blue;
    }
}

// This function writes the resulting image perfectly
dlib::save_png(warped_image, ""warped_image.png"");

// This does not :-(
std::ofstream ppm(""warped_image.ppm"");
ppm &lt;&lt; ""P6"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
ppm &lt;&lt; ""112 112"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
ppm &lt;&lt; ""255"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

/* Old code to write the PPM file
pt = warped;
for (int row=0; row&lt;h; row++) {
    for (int col=0; col&lt;w; col++) {
        ppm &lt;&lt; *(pt++) &lt;&lt; "" "";
        ppm &lt;&lt; *(pt++) &lt;&lt; "" "";
        ppm &lt;&lt; *(pt++) &lt;&lt; "" "";
    }
}*/

// New code to write the PPM file.
ppm.write( reinterpret_cast&lt;char*&gt;(warped), w * h * chs);
ppm.close();
</code></pre>

<p>The expected result is a ppm file similar to the png file written using dlib.</p>

"2545123","<p>Two Delphi programs need to load foo.dll, which contains some code that injects a client-auth certificate into a SOAP request.  foo.dll resides in c:\fooapp\foo.dll and is normally loaded by c:\fooapp\foo.exe.  That works fine.  The other program needs the same functionality, but it resides in c:\program files\unwantedstepchild\sadapp.exe.  Both aps load the DLL with this code:</p>

<pre><code>FOOLib := LoadLibrary('foo.dll'); 
...
If FOOLib &lt;&gt; 0 then 
begin
  FOOProc := GetProcAddress(FOOLib , 'xInjectCert');
  FOOProc(myHttpRequest, Data, CertName);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>It works great for foo.exe, as the dll is right there.  sadapp.exe fails to load the library, so FOOLib is 0, and the rest never gets called.  The sadapp.exe program therefore silently fails to inject the cert, and when we test against production, it the cert is missing, do the connection fails.  Obviously, we should have fully-qualified the path to the DLL.  Without going into a lot of details, there were aspects of the testing that masked this problem until recently, and now it's basically too late to fix in code, as that would require a full regression test, and there isn't time for that. </p>

<p>Since we've painted ourselves into a corner, I need to know if there are any options that I've overlooked.  While we can't change the code (for this release), we CAN tweak the installer.  I've found that placing c:\fooapp into the path works. As does adding a second copy of foo.dll directly into c:\program files\unwantedstepchild.
c:\fooapp\foo.exe will always be running while sadapp.exe is running, so I was hoping that Windows would find it that way, but apparently not. Is there a way to tell Windows that I really want that same DLL?  Maybe a manifest or something?  This is the sort of ""magic bullet"" that I'm looking for. 
I know I can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Modify the windows path, probably in the installer. That's ugly.</li>
<li>Add a second copy of the DLL, directly into the unwantedstepchild folder. Also ugly</li>
<li>Delay the project while we code and test a proper fix.  Unacceptable.</li>
<li>Other?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for any guidance, especially with ""Other"". I understand that this issue is not necessarily specific to Delphi.  Thanks!</p>

"17332284","<p>I have three programs -</p>

<p>Program 1: Microsoft Outlook Add-in that additionally uses MAPI. </p>

<p>Program 2: Stand-alone exe that <strong>does not</strong> make any use of MAPI</p>

<p>Program 3: Stand-alone exe that <strong>does</strong> make use of MAPI.</p>

<p>All three programs are written in C# and make use of a WinForms RichTextBox at some point.</p>

<p>On an x64 Windows 8 installation with Office 365 programs '1' and '3' have no issues, but program '2' crashes as soon as a RichTextBox control is constructed with the following stack:</p>

<pre><code>System.IO.FileNotFoundException : C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Office15\riched20.dll
at System.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo.GetVersionInfo(String fileName)
at System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox.get_CreateParams()
at System.Windows.Forms.Control..ctor(Boolean autoInstallSyncContext)
at System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase..ctor()
at System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox..ctor()
&lt;snip&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Disassembling RichTextBox.get_CreateParams() reveals that it calls LoadLibrary on 'riched20.dll', then GetModuleFileName on the loaded module. </p>

<p>For Program 2, Visual Studio tells me that it has loaded riched20.dll from the path ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\vfs\ProgramFilesCommonX86\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE15\RICHED20.DLL"". </p>

<p>The call to FileVersionInfo.GetVersionInfo() then fails because the path it was given does not exist. </p>

<p>However - program 1 (the outlook-addin) has also loaded riched20.dll from the same path - and yet somehow that succeeds! </p>

<p>Program 2 which does not load MAPI works fine, and it loads riched20.dll from C:\Windows\syswow62</p>

<p>Program 3 initializes MAPI before it creates a rich text box, and I know that certain MAPI functions will change your current working directory to the MAPI directory. This probably explains why program 3 loads office's riched20.dll and program 2 loads the system32 copy.</p>

<p>I suspect the difference between program 1 working and program 3 failing is that the vfs in the path stands for 'virtual file system' and so program 1, running as an Outlook addin, can somehow find the riched20.dll using a path that does not really exist.</p>

<p>All three programs work with prior versions of office.</p>

<p>As a work-around, calling 'LoadLibrary(""riched20.dll"") myself prior to initializing MAPI makes the problem go away - but feels like a terrible hack.</p>

<p>I also could not find any information about this 'vfs' file path and what it means on the Internet.</p>

<p>For my own education, is anyone able to explain better what is going on here?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've got as far as working out it's something to do with the 'click-to-run' feature.</p>

<p>Problem as follows.  The application I am writing makes use of A.dll.  We use a third-party vendor product (a backup program, but again this is not important) that has installed a Context Menu Handler control under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers.  Let's say the path to this is c:\Program Files\Vendor\control.dll.  </p>

<p>Now, the issue is that when my program opens a file chooser dialog (it's a Qt program that uses QFileDialog which then uses the standard Windows one), this control is loaded to provide context-sensitive right-click functionality.  This control depends on a different version of ""A.dll"" and when control.dll is loaded, my program promptly crashes.</p>

<p>I don't need this extra functionality.  What I would love to do is to prevent this specific dll (control.dll) from loading in my process.  In an object-oriented world I would simply overload LoadLibrary(), check for this specific DLL, and then call the standard one otherwise.  However this doesn't seem feasible. </p>

"17259729","<p>One should not use functions other than those in <strong>kernel32.dll</strong> from <strong>DllMain</strong>:</p>

<p>From MS documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because Kernel32.dll is guaranteed to be loaded in the process address space when the entry-point function is called, calling functions in Kernel32.dll does not result in the DLL being used before its initialization code has been executed. Therefore, the entry-point function can call functions in Kernel32.dll that do not load other DLLs. For example, DllMain can create synchronization objects such as critical sections and mutexes, and use TLS. Unfortunately, there is not a comprehensive list of safe functions in Kernel32.dll.
  <br>...
  <br>Calling functions that require DLLs other than Kernel32.dll may result in problems that are difficult to diagnose. For example, calling User, Shell, and COM functions can cause access violation errors, because some functions load other system components. Conversely, calling functions such as these during termination can cause access violation errors because the corresponding component may already have been unloaded or uninitialized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>My question:</strong> 
<br>But the documentation does not mention <strong>ntdll.dll</strong>. - Can I call <strong>LoadLibrary</strong> for <strong>""ntdll""</strong> and use functions in <strong>ntdll</strong> from <strong>DllMain</strong>:
<br>1) during <strong>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</strong> (load and use functions of ntdll)?
<br>2) during <strong>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</strong> (use functions of previously loaded ntdll)?</p>

<p>Building for release works and all the various DLLs load.  However, when I do a debug build with Visual Studio 2010, one (and only one) of the DLLs fails to load.  All the DLLs are similarly designed.  Using the debugger, I can see that <code>LoadLibrary</code> is getting error 998 (<code>ERROR_NOACCESS</code>, Invalid access to memory location.).  I turned on break at access exception and the bad access appears to occur within the <code>strcmp</code> assembly at the instruction <code>cmp al, [ecx]</code> (<code>ecx</code> is 6D655277 at this point).</p>

"32796782","<p>We have a strange problem with our Android app. In Fabric we have a very infrequent crash. It is a standard UnsatisfiedLinkError meaning that in the static initializer of the Java class, the .so library fails to load. This is what we have found out so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The problem is very rare. It happens in a couple of hundred devices out of hundreds of thousands or of installations.</p></li>
<li><p>Once it happens, it seems like restarting or even reinstallationdoes not solve it.</p></li>
<li><p>It happens across various brands like Sony, Samsung, Huawei.</p></li>
<li><p>It happens across all Android versions from 2.3 to 5.x.</p></li>
<li><p>We managed to catch it once in the office on a Nexus 1 device. When it started to happen, it always failed in the LoadLibrary call even though the same apk worked just fine on other devices.</p></li>
<li><p>When the problem happened, I removed the armv7a and x86 versions of the lib and only left the armeabi one to rule out the wrong lib was loaded, it still failed. Re-running the app through Android studio several times adding logs still caused the failure in the same place.</p></li>
<li><p>Then all of a sudden, without no obvious change, it started to work in the Nexus 1 and even after dozens of retries, we can not reproduce the problem again. The only thing that happened before it started to work was that I tried to manually install a corrupt apk with adb install which failed and the next time I loaded the app through Android studio, it worked and has worked even since. I am not sure if the failed installation of the corrupt apk somehow cleaned something out or if it was just a coincidence.</p></li>
<li><p>The thing I failed to do was to check that the armeabi .so file was actually present in the lib folder on the device when the failure occurred. I only came to think about this after it had already started to work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, to sum up. The apk is perfectly fine but and installs fine from Android studio the Play store on 99,9% of the devices but then under certain conditions (which are very rare), the LoadLibrary fails and when it does, there seems to be no obvious fix, not even reinstalling solved it but as I explained, something finally changed and when it started working on the Nexus 1, it has continued to work ever since.</p>

<p>This problem is really tricky since we have no way of reproduce it right now and we know it is affecting at least a small group of our users.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to narrow this down are welcome.</p>

I used Columbia dogs dataset: <a href=""ftp://ftp.umiacs.umd.edu/pub/kanazawa/CU_Dogs.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">ftp://ftp.umiacs.umd.edu/pub/kanazawa/CU_Dogs.zip</a></p>

<p>At first I would get a recall of 0%, but by increasing C value I managed to increase it to 62% on training set and 53% on testing set. After certain point increasing C value stopped helping (1000+) and would only slow down training.</p>

<p>Precision is really high though, if it actually manages to find dog's face it's always correct, haven't seen any false positives.</p>

<p>Could you give any advice on how I could improve recall to a descent recall quality?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Following Davis King's advice, got the accuracy to 100% on training set and 80% on testing set just by training different detector per breed. I imagine it could be even higher if I cluster them by direction they're looking to.</p>

"50835068","<p>I am using <code>dlib</code>'s <code>find_min_global</code> function, an optimization algorithm which helps to find values which minimize the output of a function. For example</p>

<pre><code>import dlib
def holder_table(x0,x1):
    return -abs(sin(x0)*cos(x1)*exp(abs(1-sqrt(x0*x0+x1*x1)/pi)))

x,y = dlib.find_min_global(holder_table,

                           [10,10],    # Upper bound constraints on x0 and x1 respectively
                           80)         # The number of times find_min_global() will call holder_table()
</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>holder_table</code> function returns the value that needs to be minimized for different values of <code>x0</code> and <code>x1</code>. </p>

<p>Here the <code>holder_table</code> function takes in only the values that need to be optimized that is <code>x0</code> and <code>x1</code>. But the function that I want to use with the <code>dlib</code> function takes more than <code>x0</code> and <code>x1</code>. The function definiton looks like so</p>

<pre><code>def holder_table(a,b,x0,x1):
    return -abs(sin(b*x0/a)*cos(x1)*exp(abs(1-sqrt(x0*x0+x1*x1)/pi)))
</code></pre>

<p>The values <code>a, b</code> are not fixed and are the outputs of another function. Now, I can directly call the function the returns <code>a, b</code> inside the <code>holder_table</code> but I dont want to end up re-calculating them because each time <code>holder_table</code> is called <code>a, b</code>  gets re-calculated and the process is time consuming. </p>

"32288601","<p>I have a special requirement, and I believe there is no other way,
that is: Detect the unloading of DLLs. I googled it and found out
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4242469/detect-when-a-module-dll-is-unloaded"">a four-years old SO</a> about this. I have chosen the same
solution: Hook <code>FreeLibrary</code>.</p>

<p>When code goes into <code>MyFreeLibrary</code>, I will hook the entry point of
the specified module in the same way (inline-hook). And in
<code>MyEntryPoint</code>, I will call the original entry point first, then
check the <code>reason</code> argument - if the value equals to
<code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>, it means that the cleanup work of this DLL is
just done, and it's going to be unloaded from the address space.
At this point, I have the chance do my job. It works.</p>

<p>So that's it ? Unfortunately, it's not finished. A very important
thing is overlooked: dependency.</p>

<p>For example, <code>a.dll</code> links against <code>b.dll</code> and <code>c.dll</code>. When you load
<code>a.dll</code>, <code>b.dll</code> and <code>c.dll</code> will be loaded (be initialized) first. This
is because <code>b.dll</code> and <code>c.dll</code> are listed in the import table of
<code>a.dll</code>, they are dependencies of <code>a.dll</code>. Similarly, when you unload
<code>a.dll</code>, <code>b.dll</code> and <code>c.dll</code> may be also unloaded if their reference
count decreased to zero. I don't know the detail about how the
loader finds out the dependencies of a DLL and unload them, The
<a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683152%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN</a> page of <code>FreeLibrary</code> didn't talk about this, I'm glad to
understand this but I did't find the information.</p>

<p>So the main problem is how to detect the unloading of dependencies
of a DLL module. I want to have the same chance to do my job.</p>

<p>A possible solution may be the import table, find out the
dependencies of a DLL from its import table, and find out the
dependencies of dependencies from their import table and so on,
find out all the dependencies, hook all the entry points, I don't
know, It sounds crazy, I need some advice here.</p>

"41790075","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I have two C++ projects. One EXE and one DLL.
The EXE loads the DLL and call its single exported function.
Eventually, I will generate even more DLLs that will be loaded and run by the EXE</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>EXE and all DLLs will use some resource. So, instead of adding the resource to all DLLs, I'd like to add it, once, to the EXE and wish the DLL to load the resource from the caller EXE.</p>

<h3>Attempt</h3>

<p>I already know how to load my own resource using: <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms648042(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>FindResource()</code></a>, <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms648046(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>LoadResource()</code></a>, <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms648047(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>LockResource()</code></a>. All I'm missing is the <code>hModule</code> to the caller process.</p>

<p>In addition I've read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/39540262/1798187"">Can you get the caller DLL or executable module from the callee</a></p>

"41962166","<p>I am a beginner in c++ classes and using dlib face detector. In the example code for use with webcam, the face detection and pose model are loaded inside the main function like this:</p>

<pre><code>int main(){
    frontal_face_detector detector = get_frontal_face_detector();
    shape_predictor pose_model;
    deserialize(""shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat"") &gt;&gt; pose_model;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>However, my project is structured in a way that dlib face detection is called through another function instead of main as in the example. Therefore, I need to make the models global so that the function that performs dlib knows what 'detector' and 'pose_model' are without having to pass it in as arguments to that function. Is there anyway to do that? If I load the models inside the function itself then it gets loaded everytime I call the function, thereby reducing performance. </p>

<p>static dlib::frontal_face_detector detector;
 static dlib::shape_predictor pose_model;</p>

<p>Currently I am using 'static' to load them inside the function itself but I am not sure if that is correct C++? Apologies for weird format of the question as this is my first question on this forum. Appreciate the understanding and help!!
Thanks</p>

so let's say I have Point (x,y) and a vector of values, which are used to find the minimum and fit the error locally, so I implemented this class:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
#include &lt;dlib/optimization.h&gt;
class Point
{
   int _x, _y;
public:
    Point(int x, int y): _x(x), _y(y){}

    double findError(const double&amp; psi)
    {
        auto err = std::erf(_x - psi) - std::erf(_y-psi);
        return std::pow(err,2);
    }
    double optimize(const Point&amp; p, dlib::matrix&lt;double,0,1&gt; &amp;psiValues)
    {
         auto err = p-&gt;*findError ;
         dlib::find_min_box_constrained(bfgs_search_strategy(),  
                             objective_delta_stop_strategy(1e-9),  
                             findError, derivative(findError), psiValues, {0.1,0.5,0.9},{0.1,0.4,0.8 });
        return psiValues(0);
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>and this code don't compile so I tried to extract the optimizer in a static class    like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
//#include &lt;dlib/optimization.h&gt;
class Point
{
   int _x, _y;
public:
   Point(int x, int y): _x(x), _y(y){}

    double findError(const double&amp; psi)
   {
       auto err = std::erf(_x - psi) - std::erf(_y-psi);
       return std::pow(err,2);
   }
};

class Errorcalculator
{
public:

    static double optimize(const Point&amp; p, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &amp;psiValues)
    {
        auto err = p-&gt;*findError ;
        // dlib::find_min_box_constrained(bfgs_search_strategy(),  
        //                     objective_delta_stop_strategy(1e-9),  
        //                     p-&gt;*findError, derivative(p-&gt;*findError), psiValue, {0.1,0.9 },{0.1 0.8});
        return 0.0;
    }
 };
</code></pre>

<p>now I'm getting (the same compile error using dlib function with or without static keyword)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>error: 'findError' was not declared in this scope</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is it possible if the point p is declared as parameter? How can I use the dlib function wrapped in the class?</p>

"14303271","<p>I need to port an application (<strong>written in XE2</strong>) to Mac.</p>

<p>My application is split into a simple <code>UI executable</code> (single-threaded) and an invisible <code>engine</code> (which <strong>heavily relies on OmniThreadLibrary 3.02</strong> and <strong><a href=""http://www.cromis.net/blog/downloads/directory-watch/"">Cromis DirectoryWatch</a></strong>)</p>

<p>My focus right now is the Engine, which has most of the code.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> Is there something similar to <strong>OmniThreadLibrary, Cromis DirectoryWatch &amp; Cromis.IPC</strong> for Mac? (Whether with lazarus or XE2 with Mac as a target compiler)</p>

<p>The answer will help me a lot in deciding whether I should use Delphi XE2 or Lazarus (an IDE which I'm not familiar <strong>at all</strong> with) and see <strong>what's the best long term approach to offer/support both Windows &amp; Mac with the minimum headaches</strong></p>

"7693596","<p>OK, so I have a situation in which I call <code>LoadLibrary</code> on a DLL that I wrote. This call to LoadLibrary returns error #998, or <code>ERROR_NOACCESS</code> ""Invalid access to memory location.""</p>

<p>The DLL in question uses MFC in one configuration, and not in another; only the MFC configuration has this problem. It <em>used to work</em>, but I have no idea what I changed: I'd actually moved on to the non-MFC version and been tinkering quite a lot with that and I have no idea what I could have done that affected the MFC version.</p>

<p>I don't know a lot about DLLs. The original loading code was actually given to me, and I haven't changed it. Below is that code:</p>

<pre><code>// submodule loading
#ifndef MFC
// Project uses standard windows libraries, define an entry point for the DLL to handle loading/unloading
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HANDLE hDllHandle, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpreserved)
{
    _MESSAGE(""DllMain called."");
    switch(dwReason)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:    // dll loaded
        hModule = (HMODULE)hDllHandle;  // store module handle
        _MESSAGE(""Attaching Submodule ...""); 
        break;
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:    // dll unloaded
        _MESSAGE(""Detaching Submodule ..."");      
        break;
    }   
    return true;
}
#else
// Project uses MFC, we define here an instance of CWinApp to make this a 'well-formed' DLL
class CSubmoduleApp : public CWinApp
{
public:
    virtual BOOL InitInstance()
    {// dll loaded
        hModule = m_hInstance;  // store module handle
        _MESSAGE(""Attaching Submodule ..."");
        return true;
    }
    virtual int ExitInstance()
    {// dll unloaded
       _MESSAGE(""Detaching Submodule ..."");      
       return CWinApp::ExitInstance();
    }
} gApp;
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, <code>MFC</code> is defined in the MFC configuration, and not otherwise.</p>

<p>I doubt this is enough information to solve this problem; I realize that. What I'm actually hoping to learn is <em>where to look for problems</em> that might cause this error. I'll be happy to supply any information you need — once I know it's needed.</p>

<p>Thanks for any tips.</p>

"23791995","<p>Okay so I'm coming dangerously close to a repost here but my situation is a little bit different than the numerous other posters about this function. I am interfacing with a DLL that was written way back in the day and all I have is the file. I don't have a .lib file so I'm using the LoadLibrary and GetProcessAddress functions. I followed the tutorial on the MSDN website to get the basic structure. the DLL is located in the project folder. it compiles. at run time, I am getting a numerical value for ""hinstLib"" so I'm assuming the DLL was found. I am getting a null value for ""ProcAdd"" variable. Other posters had there issues resolved by putting extern C in the DLL functions but I don't really have that option. not to mention, to my knowledge this DLL was written in plain C.  I do have an interface document and am quite sure I have the function name correct (replaced with a generic example for these purposes). I honestly didn't run anything past the ProcAdd assignment because it came out NULL. Any thoughts as to why this is giving me a 0 value for the function assignment would be great appreciated. Note: unfortunately due to various reasons I can't upload the DLL.</p>

<pre><code>    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include ""stdafx.h""
    #include ""Windows.h""
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 

    typedef int(__cdecl *MYPROC)(LPWSTR);

      if (hinstLib != NULL) 
    { 
    ProcAdd = (MYPROC) GetProcAddress(hinstLib, ""funcName""); 

    // If the function address is valid, call the function.

    if (NULL != ProcAdd) 
    {
        fRunTimeLinkSuccess = TRUE;
        //(ProcAdd) (L""Message sent to the DLL function\n""); 
    }
    // Free the DLL module.

    fFreeResult = FreeLibrary(hinstLib);

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I reopened this question, since even after applied the changes illustrated in my own question, I still get the very same error report today...</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>: It seems that the error happened when the thread is terminating and the thread message that's being sent when the error happened was <code>COmniTaskMsg_Terminated</code>. Now it's very strange - I've replaced almost all calls to <code>Task.Comm.Send()</code> in my program with a thread-safe queue, so I'm quite sure the number of thread messages go through <code>Task.Comm</code> is a very small, far less than that might fill up the Windows message queue...</p>

<p>I know that <code>The 'using' keyword in template aliasing is not fully supported yet</code> in swig, so maybe I should somehow change <code>template</code> expression, but what exactly should I do?</p>

<p>Also, <code>using namespace dlib;</code> occurs to <code>Error: Nothing known about namespace 'dlib'</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that I don't want to directly use this code in Java. I want to use it in the C++ function which I will use in Java via <code>void fun(char *input_string, double *output_param)</code> interface.</strong></p>

"15250456","<p>I have native source code written in C that I would like to run on my Android device (Nexus 7). I already successfully did lots of research and online tutorials on running native code on Android using Android NDK. I gained quite some knowledge on this.
However, the code that I have makes use of the complex functionalities of the standard math library, defined in complex.h. The NDK C library however does not seem to support the complex functionalities. Whenever I do an ndk-build on the project I get:</p>

<pre><code>fatal error: complex.h: no such file or directory.
</code></pre>

<p>As a solution I thought of getting the standard math library (libm.a) from arm-linux-gnueabi and link it with my native source. Here is my Android.mk:</p>

<pre><code>LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := StandardC
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := libc.a
include $(PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY)

include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := mathLib
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := libm.a
LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := StandardC
include $(PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY)

include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := ComplexOperations
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := libComplexOperations.a
LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := mathLib
LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/include
include $(PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY)

include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := MySource
LOCAL_CFLAGS += -std=c99
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := com_samuel_test_ComplexOperationsLib.c
LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/include
LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := ComplexOperations
include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</code></pre>

<p>I had to link the libc of the arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc as well as libm needs it.
The ""ComplexOperations"" module was statically compiled using arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc with compiler flags -march=armv7-a. This library makes use of complex.h.
This builds without any errors and warnings. But when I run the application and call</p>

<pre><code>System.loadLibrary(""MySource"");
</code></pre>

<p>I get this error on logcat:</p>

<pre><code>E/dalvikvm( 3932): dlopen(""/data/app-lib/com.samuel.test-1/libMySource.so"") failed: Cannot load library: soinfo_relocate(linker.cpp:975): cannot locate symbol "".LANCHOR2"" referenced by ""libMySource.so""...

<p>At the moment it is working great - storing the original image on my server and also creating two additional thumbnails, with their widths re-sized at 300px and 150px.</p>

<li>Full/Original image is stored on server (as normal)</li>

<p>However, is it possible, so that once the image width/height is resized, the additional canvas width/height is then added to make it completely square? I guess one of the issues here is determining if the image is a 'portrait' or 'landscape' first?</p>

"41991651","<p>This is likely more of a c++ question, but it does relate to DLIB. I am using another library to load images into memory (Leadtools). I want to replace the ""load_image"" function with assignments, but I am having trouble figuring out how to do so. I have all the information and memory allocated I need from my load, such as pixel bit depth, width, height, width_step, rgb/bgr order, and a pointer to the data. </p>

<p>So in the sample, there is:</p>

<pre><code>array2d&lt;bgr_pixel&gt; img;

<p>I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>img.set_size(mywidth, myheight);

<pre><code>img.data = mydatapointer;  
</code></pre>

<p>does not work - there is no img.data, plus I can't figure out how to use image_view.</p>

<p>What is the right way to setup that data pointer? Note that I do NOT want to duplicate memory :-)</p>

<p>Is there anything else that needs setting in order to simulate the load_image and have the correct structure to use within dlib?</p>

<p>However, this DLL starts to crash after I call it too many times.  So, I switched to using <code>LoadLibrary()</code> instead as described in this blog entry, which lets me unload and reload the DLL when desired:</p>

Trying to compile a lib.so with Android NDK r9d for using native code in my Android app. Since the lib.so is a big thirdparty with lot of dependences, I have not done the typical NDK project (with Android.mk and so on); Instead, I have used the standard compile.sh that comes with the lib sources and make pertinent changes on it to use NDK toolchain.<br>
Finally, lib.so is compiled without errors.  </p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
When I test lib.so in my Android app I get ""rare"" (for me) errors. Here LogCat (if somebody knows how to ""expand"" the ""... 15 more"" message, I'll do it):  </p>

<p>Now, I've checked the paths and they are correct. I don't get any syntax errors, runtime errors, nothing. The script runs, but no output is produced other than the following print statement: <code>print(""Found {0} faces!"".format(len(faces)))</code>. </p>

<p>I assume it runs what comes after it, but there is no output on the screen and nothing is saved in my home folder (which is were the output pictures of cropped mouths are normally stored). The original script which was meant to work with one image only works perfectly, but this one doesn't seem to do the trick. </p>

<p>Any ideas and suggestions would be highly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p>P.S if the problem is with the code after the line that gets printed, I still didn't start working on that part for this script because I believe it is the code above the print statement that is faulty in some way</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EFFORTS UPDATE</strong> : 
It has been pointed out to me by @Dai that these lines help construct a color code of an individual RGB pixel. So I guess this part can remained unchanged ? </p>

<pre><code>$rgb = imagecolorat($image, $x, $y);
$r = ($rgb &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF;
$g = ($rgb &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF;
$b = $rgb &amp; 0xFF;            
$alpha = ($rgb &amp; 0x7F000000) &gt;&gt; 24;
</code></pre>

<p>In the next line we are simply converting the RGB values to HSL with <code>rgb2hsl($r, $g, $b);</code> and assigning it to <code>list($h, $s, $l)</code>. The point I am stuck at the moment are these lines.</p>

<pre><code>$s += $saturationPercentage / 100;
if($s &gt; 1) $s--;
</code></pre>

<p>I understand the syntax, but not sure how I handle these or if they are even required. If not an answer helpful hints / suggestions would be great. I am trying the code on <a href=""http://postimg.org/image/rhnft3y0n/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this image</a> to bring down the saturation from 100% to 80%, but I am getting <a href=""http://postimg.org/image/xnewygrvv/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this image</a> as result.</p>

"33013347","<p>I have an assembly in <code>.NET</code>, which I have exposed via <code>COM</code> and strongly named.</p>

<p>Upon deployment, this assembly needs to be present in the <code>GAC</code>. However, I need to check whether it exists before creating its object.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even putting the object creation within a try / catch results in <code>unhandled exception</code> during runtime, if the assembly is not present in the GAC.</p>

<p>So there has to be some way for me to verify, if the DLL is indeed installed in the GAC before I go on to create the object.</p>

<pre><code>HINSTANCE histLib;
    histLib = LoadLibrary(""CLSInterOpLibrary.dll"");
    if (histLib == NULL)
        return false;
    encode();

    CoInitialize(NULL);
    try
    {
        CLSInterOpLibrary::CLSInterOpInterfacePtr p(__uuidof(CLSInterOpLibrary::CLSInterOpClass));
        if (p == nullptr)
            return false;
        com_ptr = p;
    }
    catch (exception &amp;e)
    {

    }
</code></pre>

<p><code>LoadLibrary</code> gives a NULL, regardless of whether the library is present in GAC or not, probably needs some sort of path..., and </p>

<pre><code>CLSInterOpLibrary::CLSInterOpInterfacePtr p(__uuidof(CLSInterOpLibrary::CLSInterOpClass));
</code></pre>

<p>..gives an unhandled exception if the DLL is not present.</p>

<p>So how would one check if a<code>DLL</code> is installed in<code>GAC</code> with<code>C++?</code> Or is there a more elegant solution to this?</p>

"33279931","<p>I had cause to check the types exported by a module, and I immediately thought ""right, module_info then"" but was surprised to run into a few difficulties. I found I can get the exported types from modules I compile, but not from say modules in stdlib.</p>

<p>My (three) questions are, how do I reliably get the exported types of a module, why are the exported types in the attributes bit of the module info on some modules, and why some modules and not others?</p>

<p>I discovered that if I build this module:</p>

<pre><code>-module(foo).
-export([bar/0]).
-export_types([baz/0]).
bar() -&gt; bat .
</code></pre>

<p>And then use foo:module_info/0, I get this:</p>

<pre><code>[{exports,[{bar,0},{module_info,0},{module_info,1}]},
 {imports,[]},
 {attributes,[{vsn,[108921085595958308709649797749441408863]},
              {export_types,[{baz,0}]}]},

           {time,{2015,10,22,10,38,8}},
           {source,""/tmp/foo.erl""}]}]
</code></pre>

<p>Great, hidden away in 'attributes' is 'export_types'. Why this is in attributes I'm not quite sure, but... whatever...</p>

<p>I now know this will work:</p>

<pre><code>4&gt; lists:keyfind(export_types, 1, foo:module_info(attributes)).
{export_types,[{baz,0}]}
</code></pre>

<p>Great. So, I now know this will work:</p>

<pre><code>5&gt; lists:keyfind(export_types, 1, ets:module_info(attributes)).
false
</code></pre>

<p>Ah... it doesn't.</p>

<p>I know there are exported types of course, if the documentation isn't good enough the ets source shows:</p>

<pre><code>-export_type([tab/0, tid/0, match_spec/0, comp_match_spec/0, match_pattern/0]).
</code></pre>

<p>In fact the exported type information for the ets module doesn't seem to be anywhere in the module info:</p>

<pre><code>6&gt; rp(ets:module_info()).

"53859419","<p>my first time over here, but I really searched about it and sadly I haven't found help.</p>

<p>I have an algorithm of facial recognition... Currently, I am trying to improve the efficiency of it. </p>

<p>After some study, I concluded that the <strong>dlib.get_frontal_face_detector ()</strong> was the function slowing down my code.</p>

<p>Then, my approach was to remove the background of my figures and extract only the differences between the two images. After it, I have pieces of image, cropped from the full and original one, and this pieces with only the differences are much smaller (e.g. Full Image: 1520 x 2592 pixels and Cropped Image With Face: 150x200 pixels). </p>

<p>OBS: Camera of detection it is very far of the people being recognized, because of this the faces are tiny in the images and much of this size are useless, because of it I decided to remove the useless parts.</p>

<p>BUT, here things got crazy: 
When I apply the tiny, smaller, cropped face to the <strong>dlib.get_frontal_face_detector ()</strong> it SOMETIMES doesn't recognizes it! (there are times where it recognizes, it's weird!). It sounds weird because when I apply the Full Image to the face_detector, yet with same resolution, only with larger shape, it recognizes the same face!</p>

<p>I think I am missing some theoretical information here...</p>

<pre><code>detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()

new_image = []
im2, contours, hierarchy  = cv2.findContours(im_bw,cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL,cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
for contour in contours:
    [x, y, w, h] = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
    #print(x, y, w, h)
    if h&lt;20 or w&lt;20:
        continue
    else:
        new_image.append(img2_n[y*inv_coef:y*inv_coef+h*inv_coef, x*inv_coef:x*inv_coef+w*inv_coef])

for images in new_image:
    rgb_img = cv2.cvtColor(images, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    dets = detector(rgb_img, 1)

<p>Above the extractor of smaller images and using it on the detector. Below, the simple code where I apply the full image to the same detector.</p>

<pre><code>full_img = cv2.cvtColor(img2, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
dets = detector(full_img, 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone that understands a little bit more of DLIB and OPENCV and PYTHON could help me?</p>

<p>OBS¹: The images that are not being recognized are larger than the threshold defined in the for to trash away too small pieces of image.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I could write my own function but I do not have access to Dlib's HOG detector. Is it possible to run just the detector and linear classifier on my own, without using the <code>scan_fhog_pyramid()</code> function to find ROIs?</p>

<p>I hope my question is clear enough...</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>In both cases I obtain the score of the results, and the detection works quite well. (even if its a small data set).</p>

<p>My doubt is, if i chose the window to occupy the whole height of the image during the training (in SVM and DNN), and if i increase the dataset so that i use 1 or 2 k of images, could i detect scratches, or other defects?</p>

<p>Another question is, if I detect these defects, could i visualize them.</p>

"41790515","<p>I have been evaluating the performance of dlib for a while. Today I have realized that the standard face detector (ie. created with dlib::get_frontal_face_detector() method) finds faces that are 73x73. However I know that, dlib can find at least 80x80 objects if there is no upsampling. as far as I know there is no upsampling in standard face detector. </p>

<p>I know that dlib::frontal_face_detector is a typedef:</p>

<pre><code>typedef object_detector&lt;scan_fhog_pyramid&lt;pyramid_down&lt;6&gt; &gt; &gt; frontal_face_detector;
</code></pre>

<p>So by reading this typedef, one can conclude that this detector always downscaling the image by the ratio: 5/6 = 0,83. </p>

<p>So what is the explanation of this situation?

errors and sets the fIsDone and fHasError flags, getting read by someone from mainthread. </p>

If the bit versions mismatch or the file doesn't exist, the function returns <code>NULL</code> and no <code>Debug Assertion Failed</code> message.</p>

<p>I've a C# solution with excel Add-in and winforms application and library project with only one method.</p>

<p>project with library have next code:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""Kernel32.dll"", SetLastError = true, CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)]
public static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string filename);
public sealed class LibraryInfo
{
    public readonly IntPtr Handle;
    public LibraryInfo(string dllName)
    {
        Handle = LoadLibrary(dllName);
    }
}
public LibraryInfo GetLib(string name)
{
    return new LibraryInfo(name);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Look's like simple. 
So I've a call of that method from add-ins and from WinForms</p>

<p>I've a Dll, builded for x64 platform and x86 platform.</p>

<p>And now magic:
LoadLibrary returns <strong>error code 127</strong> <strong><em>only</em></strong> when I run it from Add-in and x64 configuration and on <strong>excel-2016</strong>(<strong>x64</strong>, ofcourse). When I run it on x86, or winform (both x86 and x64) it works. And it is not all, when I run it on Excel 2013 it's works fine too!!!</p>

<p>mayby somebody knows?</p>

<p>Im writing a gui application with qt in c++.
At the moment I'm stuck on loading and saving dlls which were passed to me.
For loading and saving i decided to set functions for load- and save- tasks. But the main problem is the loading of different DLL files.</p>

<p>i have the following code at the moment for loading and saving, but getting errors when i'm switching from loading to saving. i know it have something to do with ""FreeLibrary()"" function. But in case FreeLibrary(hDLLimp) is executed i cannot repeat loading my ""implib.dll"". The returned hDLLimp is 0.
In case i comment FreeLibrary out, the loading function can be re-executed several times. But saving function dont work. hDLLexp becomes ""0"" and the handle is gone.</p>

"36047891","<p>I've created an IOmniTaskControl using a TOmniWorker, so that I can periodically run chunks of code an a specific thread.

<p>I tried calling WaitFor(INFINITE) on the IOmniTaskControl after the Invoke, but it hangs.  I debugged and could see the method on the Invoke call completed.  Am I misunderstanding the use of WaitFor with IOmniTaskControl when used with a TOmniWorker?</p>

<p>Edit:  I edited up the test_43_InvokeAnonymous project in the test folder and I see the same behavior:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TfrmInvokeAnonymousDemo.btnInvokeClick(Sender: TObject);

But since the dlib library doesn't work directly on video(or I don't know if it does), I am providing frames to the image face detection program. For a small video such as 20-30 frame video it is working fine, but if given a bigger video it is having buffer overflow error. Do I have to remove data or clear some dynamic memory explicitly? Or does it only handle few images for face detection?</p>

<p>Below is the code snippet </p>

"46548220","<p>I am using <code>dlib</code> for a program that classifies medical images using SVM. Because the images are large (many features, say 10000 to 100000) and I use a linear kernel, it sounds as though the <code>svm_c_linear_dcd_trainer</code> is a good class to use.</p>

<p>Another reason that I like the <code>svm_c_linear_dcd_trainer</code> class is that it claims to support 'warm starting', so if a single observation is often added to/subtracted from the sample (such as in LOOCV) that is efficient for long vectors.</p>

<p>But the only example of <code>svm_c_linear_dcd_trainer</code> uses one_class classification. The documentation suggests that the <code>force_last_weight_to_1</code> option that implements the warm start, is for 1-class classification only.</p>

<p>Is that true, i.e. is this warm-start option not available for binary classification? An in that case, would another implementation be faster?</p>

"12303776","<p>I've started to look at using Omnithread to improve my Delphi Application using multithreading. Creating one or more worker tasks are well covered by the documentation so that long actions that I invoke from button clicks can be replaced by this demo code (Async, CreateTask etc). Where I am having difficulty though is in how to replace my most 'messy' code which operates as follows.</p>

<p>I have a concept of a single class instance that corresponds to a hardware module. The class publishes one or more properties that expose current values and settings for the hardware. Properties might be read only or read / write. For each of these class instances there can be from zero to several display forms visible. A display form has a TTimer and a built list of the aformentioned published properties. This list is iterated to match up suitably named controls such as labels or edit controls and an RTTI mechanism is used to get and set values between the control and its property. The result is a form which provides a nice UI on to the actual hardware module with the side effect than multiple forms can be open, modifying data on one of them causes the others to show that data shortly after. This property monitoring is performed by the TTimer ticking at 300 ms intervals. Each tick causes it to scan through all properties of the class and to refresh the matching control on its form. The timer runs for the lifetime of the open form. Forms are created when needed and then freed (this has the useful performance optimisation that with no forms open to inspect the hardware, the Application must run as fast as possible because no monitoring tasks can be running).</p>

<p>Is there a better way of using threading to access my published properties, rather than using a TTimer in the UI thread? Or would synchronisation issues outweigh any advantages? If threading is useful, how would one create a repeating task such as to emulate the ticking timer?</p>

"36265485","<p>I'm using an IOmniTaskControl/TOmniWorker to funnel code execution onto a specific thread.  I'll reuse this IOmniTaskControl repeatedly for multiple Invoke calls.  How do I check for exceptions that may have occurred during the Invoke?  This is a follow on question to the question/answer: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36047891/waiting-for-invoke-to-finish-when-using-iomnitaskcontrol-tomniworker"">Waiting for Invoke to finish when using IOmniTaskControl/TOmniWorker</a>.</p>

<p>I've checked the ExitCode and FatalException of the IOmniTaskControl but they are not set. It seems that the IOmniTaskControl will create a new task automatically for each Invoke call, and the exception gets placed onto that task, if it occurs.  However, I have no reference to that task following the completion of the Invoke.  I'm using a TOmniWaitableValue to flag when the invoke completes, but not clear on what I will need to do to make any exception that occurred available to me on return from the WaitFor(...).</p>

<p>Here is a snippet of the structure I have:</p>

<pre><code>interface

type
  TMyTaskProc = reference to procedure;

  TMyTask = class
  private
    FWorker:      IOmniWorker;
    FTaskControl: IOmniTaskControl;
    FWaitable:    IOmniWaitableValue;
  public
    constructor Create;
    destructor Destroy; override;

    procedure AwaitInvoke(Proc: TMyTaskProc); overload;
  end;

implementation

type
  TMyTaskWorker = class(TOmniWorker);

constructor TMyTask.Create;
begin
  inherited;

  FWorker := TMyTaskWorker.Create;
  FTaskControl := CreateTask(FWorker).Run;
  FWaitable := TOmniWaitableValue.Create;
end;

destructor TMyTask.Destroy;
begin
  FTaskControl.Terminate;
  FTaskControl := nil;

  FWaitable := nil;

  inherited;
end;

procedure TMyTask.AwaitInvoke(Proc: TMyTaskProc);
begin
  FWaitable.Reset;

  FTaskControl.Invoke(
    procedure
    begin
      try
        Proc();
      finally
        FWaitable.Signal;
      end;
    end
  );

  FWaitable.WaitFor(INFINITE);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>So in the above setup, how can I check after FWaitable.WaitFor(INFINITE) for any exception that might have occurred during the Proc() call. I'd like to just raise it again at that point in the calling thread.</p>

I am assuming it has something to do with the PivotalR package for RStudio. Is there a way to make the <code>forest_train</code> work directly from RStudio?</p>

"33348958","<p>Currently we're working on the subject of manually loading DLL in lower 4Gbs of process' virtual address space on x64 platform. It is needed because DLL is written with explicit usage of 32-bit types everywhere and cannot be rewritten. So we are to use this peculiarity in the project and we are to make sure DLL uses only lower 4Gbs to stay workable.</p>

<p>There are some links across the web with implementation of manual DLL loading, we've taken this one as a base: <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/430684/Loading-Win-DLLs-manually-without-LoadLibrary"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a></p>

<p>This variant works. There are only some issues detected so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>No debug with sources is possible now, OS just doesn't see this module, it is a merely memory region for it and nothing else, so no PDB is loaded.</li>
<li>Our project is implemented in such a way that DLL calls function from external framework where some payload is located. Then exception is raised in the framework (on purpose, not occasionally) and here is where problem occurs. This exception remains unhandled but handler is present in the code of the framework.</li>
</ol>

<p>When DLL is loaded via LoadLibrary on x86 or x64 (and we're lucky it loads in lower 4Gbs region) everything works just fine. We can see the whole SEH chain (in WinDbg, for example) and exception is handled fine.</p>

<p>When loading DLL manually WinDbg shows something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;!exchain
Frame 0x01: MSVCR120D!__ExceptionPtr::_RethrowException+0x1e1 (000007fe`d9cf4281)
ehandler MSVCR120D!__GSHandlerCheck (000007fe`d9e11eb0)

Frame 0x10: error getting module for 0000000000000004
</code></pre>

<p>We've tried turning <code>/SafeSEH</code> option off but with the same result. We've done it because one guess was that OS can refuse to process exception handlers which are not in protected modules.</p>

<p>Current guess on why it happens is that OS needs so to say internally visible module (with some kernel objects created in the process of DLL loading via legal system function LoadLibrary) where exception chain can go through.</p>

<p>What do you think about possible solutions to this issue?</p>

When the service is started automatically with system startup, sometimes (like 1 in 10) it fails. Problem is with LoadLibrary function which is in fact the first thing it does. It is a load of our DLL where the most of the code is. I can't reproduce it on my computers, so I am just sending special testing binaries to colleague abroad. I added text outputs to file using unbuffered write operation so I can see exactly where it disappears. There is no crash dump, there is no exception, there is no NULL retrived, it just exits somewhere in LoadLibrary and service is not running after system startup. Our library does not have DllMain, but if I add it, it does not get there (in fail case). I tried delay loading of dependent system libraries, no success. It seems like sometimes something is not yet started in Windows and so the initialization fails, I am not sure. But adding sleep before LoadLibrary does not solve the problem (too late to sleep?). Do you have any ideas what is going on and how to proceed? I am currently going to remove the code from our DLL step by step to remove the lib dependencies one by one to see if in some moment it will start to work. I will be happy to provide additional information when needed.</p>

<p>which works perfectly fine for VBA of Offices 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016 even the Office 2019. 32 and 64 bits.</p>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bwQmk.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bwQmk.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When running the above VBA code in Office from Microsoft Store the line:</p>

<pre><code>LoadLibrary(""func1.dll"")
</code></pre>

<p>returns 0, meaning that the DLL was not loaded. So, I ran out of ideas in order to get this to work, but with no success til now.</p>

<p>Here are some additional information about the problem and what I've tried to do:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Copying the DLL to executable path. For instance, if I place<code>func1.dll</code> (and <code>func2.dll</code>) in <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14</code> I can use <code>LoadLibrary</code>without the need of using <code>SetEnvironmentVariable ""PATH"", dllpath</code>. But I cannot copy the DLL to the path of Office from Microsoft Store <code>C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.Office.Desktop.Word_16040.10827.20181.0_x86__8wekyb3d8bbwe\Office16</code> because it gives access denied;</p></li>
<li><p>I completely sure that <code>SetEnvironmentVariable ""PATH"", dllpath</code> is working fine on Office from Microsoft Store. I tested this putting an executable inside the <code>C:\temp\DllsOffice\DLLsOffice\Debug</code> and then calling <code>Shell ""test.exe""</code> (without passing the full path) my <code>test.exe</code> program is opened normally.</p></li>

This is working great, but the issue I'm having is that sometimes I'm getting false positives that sometimes override a recently started motion track.</p>

<p>I tried logging the detector with <code>dir()</code> but couldn't find any confidence field, and checking the reference, but I couldn't find how to get this tracker to output its confidence level.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is to basically have a threshold for the quality of track that the system is willing to use, which gradually lowers as time goes by. IE, if it loses the track of my pattern and immediately picks some random corner of the image to have a low-confidence track, it won't override my recent (and therefore quality) motion track. Whereas if the motion track has been running for a long time, it is more likely to have slid off, and i'm more inclined to trust a low-quality track.</p>

"40939319","<p>I want to write a very, very small program that parses the launch arguments and chooses one of several DLLs to ""boot into.""</p>

<p>I've already written an application that I'd like to ""run"" as a DLL by writing it as an application, then changing the Visual Studio project properties to build it as a DLL instead. I know I need to use LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress in concert to get the functionality I want, but I'm having trouble finding clear and comprehensive documentation on this, as a lot of the use cases aren't really of this nature. Also, I have to go this route based on the project and platform restrictions. </p>

<p>I found <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810279.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a>, which has some information, but it's not clear enough for me to adapt for my purposes.</p>

<p>Edit: Here's where I'm at right now.</p>

<p>I have a DLL project whose main function signature looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>__declspec(dllexport) int cdecl main(int argc, char *argv[])
</code></pre>

<p>I also have an application project whose attempt at loading the DLL and running the above function looks like this:</p>

<p><code>typedef int (CALLBACK* LPFNDLLFUNC1)(int, char *);</code></p>

<p>...</p>

<pre><code>        HMODULE dllHandle = NULL;
        BOOL freeResult, runTimeLinkSuccess = FALSE;
        LPFNDLLFUNC1 lpfnDllFunc1;    // Function pointer

            dllHandle = LoadLibrary(L""TrueApplication.dll"");
            if (NULL != dllHandle)
            {
                lpfnDllFunc1 = (LPFNDLLFUNC1)GetProcAddress(dllHandle, ""main"");

"36121221","<p>I can make a basic FTP server that answers port 21 (or in this example 2121) using the sample from the documentation:</p>

<pre><code>from pyftpdlib.handlers import FTPHandler
from pyftpdlib.servers import FTPServer
from pyftpdlib.contrib.authorizers import WindowsAuthorizer

def main():
    authorizer = WindowsAuthorizer()
    # Use Guest user with empty password to handle anonymous sessions.
    # Guest user must be enabled first, empty password set and profile
    # directory specified.
    #authorizer = WindowsAuthorizer(anonymous_user=""Guest"", anonymous_password="""")

    server = FTPServer(('', 2121), handler)
    server.serve_forever()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Or I can make one that supports TLS (again this is the sample from the docs, except our secure FTP port is 990, not 21 as shown in the <a href=""https://pythonhosted.org/pyftpdlib/tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">original code sample</a>):</p>

<pre><code>from pyftpdlib.servers import FTPServer
from pyftpdlib.authorizers import DummyAuthorizer
from pyftpdlib.contrib.handlers import TLS_FTPHandler


def main():
    authorizer = DummyAuthorizer()
    authorizer.add_user('user', '12345', '.', perm='elradfmw')
    authorizer.add_anonymous('.')
    handler = TLS_FTPHandler
    handler.certfile = 'keycert.pem'
    handler.authorizer = authorizer
    # requires SSL for both control and data channel
    #handler.tls_control_required = True
    #handler.tls_data_required = True
    server = FTPServer(('', 990), handler)
    server.serve_forever()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to make one that answers port 21 (insecure) AND 990 (secured with TLS) in the same script where they share a range of passive ports, for example:</p>

<pre><code>handler.passive_ports = range(50000, 50051)
</code></pre>

<p>I imagine I could write two scripts but how will it work if they share the passive port range?  That range is a requirement and the current IIS setup we use supports both TLS and insecure connections.  I want to use pyftpdlib in a customized server so we can perform custom logic on uploaded files.  All that works fine, I just need to understand this last bit and I'm not experienced in writing FTP servers.</p>

#write the detected file in text file
with open(""Model1.txt"",""w"") as file:

        outer += str(vec[i])
        file.write(outer)
        file.write(""\n"")

#read the text file and remove the brackets
with open(""Model1.txt"",""r"") as my_file:
    text=my_file.read()
    text= text.replace(""["","""")
    text= text.replace(""]"","""")

#again write the file. 
with open(""Model1.txt"",""w"") as file:
    file.write(text)

#function for reading points from text file
def readPoints(path) :
    # Create an array of points.
    points = [];

    # Read points
    with open(path) as file :
        for line in file :
            x, y = line.split()
            points.append((int(x), int(y)))
    return points
</code></pre>

<p>So, here, i need to detect facial landmarks and read it directly so it can be used for face swap. Or, if it cannot be done, i need to detect facial landmarks and write it into text file without bracket at once, so that, i do not have to read and write the text file twice and remove brackets. </p>

"43814073","<p>I am using <code>Dlib</code> and <code>OpenCV</code> with <code>C++</code> <code>Without CMake</code>on <code>Visual Studio 2015</code> and I have tried the <code>face_landmark_detection_ex</code> example to detect faces by using the laptop camera and it works fine. but I wonder why <code>Dlib</code> is saying: <code>164 of 8616 functions ( 1.9%) were compiled, the rest were copied from previous compilation.</code></p>

<p>I think that example is very simple and does not require 8000+ function to work, I also wonder why it needs 57 Folders and 73 <code>Header Files</code> from the library.</p>

<p>The dependency hierarchy is not clear at all from the documentation on the Dlib's official website.</p>

<p>Note: I have added <code>source.cpp</code> file to my project because i was getting <code>Linker Error</code>, this could be referenced to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In most cases, to use this library all you have to do is extract it
  somewhere, make sure the folder containing the dlib folder is in your
  include path, and finally add dlib/all/source.cpp to your project. It
  is worth noting that most of dlib is ""header-only"" which means that,
  in many cases, you don't actually have to build dlib/all/source.cpp
  into your application. So if you don't get linker errors when you
  exclude dlib/all/source.cpp from your project then you don't need it.</p>

"53947448","<p>I am trying to make an hair swapping application in python. I have successfully, extract out hair. However, it has not given satisfied result. But for the final part, I need to take hair image from sample head and put that in sample model image. For that, I use seamless cloning. Here's my code for it and final image:</p>

<pre><code>import cv2
import numpy as np

# Read images : src image will be cloned into dst
im = cv2.imread(""source.jpg"")
obj = cv2.imread(""hair.jpg"")
# Create an all white mask
mask = 255 * np.ones(obj.shape, obj.dtype)

# The location of the center of the src in the dst
width, height, channels = im.shape
center = (250, 115)

# Seamlessly clone src into dst and put the results in output
mixed_clone = cv2.seamlessClone(obj, im, mask, center, cv2.MIXED_CLONE)

# Write results
cv2.imwrite(""normal-clone.jpg"", mixed_clone)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre>

<p>And from above, I get following result:

<p>I know its not good looking, but the main problem here is when I use affine transformation for scaling and rotation purpose and then seamless cloning using following code:</p>

<pre><code>import cv2
import numpy as np

# Read images : src image will be cloned into dst

pts2 = np.float32([[151,196],[250,33],[347,196]])

M = cv2.getAffineTransform(pts1,pts2)

dst = cv2.warpAffine(obj,M,(cols,rows))

# Create an all white mask
mask = 255 * np.ones(dst.shape, dst.dtype)

# The location of the center of the src in the dst
width, height, channels = im.shape
center = (250, 115)

# Seamlessly clone src into dst and put the results in output

<p>I have another code written for those coordinate points generation. I will merge them later, so that, I do not have to input those coordinate points manually. 
But for now, I want to know, why affine transformation affecting seamless cloning. What am I doing wrong??</p>

<p>Or, any solution for hair swapping will be appreciated.</p>

"54155910","<p>I'm trying to use the python <code>dlib.train_shape_predictor</code> function to train using a very large set of images (~50,000). </p>

<p>I've created an xml file containing the necessary data, but it seems like train_shape_predictor loads all the referenced images into RAM before it starts training.

"26040277","<p>I want to use optimization algorithm lbfgs in my project but I do not want to code it myself. So I found <code>Dlib</code> is a good option.</p>

<p><a href=""http://dlib.net/compile.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://dlib.net/compile.html</a> is a good library. I downloaded it. I use windows 7 and visual studio 2012. If I create a new win 32 console project and set <code>property-&gt;configuration properties-&gt;VC++ Directories-&gt;Include Directories</code> to the path of <code>Dlib</code>(dlib-18.10/).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3568z.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And it works fine which mean I can run examples.</p>

<p>But when I add it to my project. I occur errors.(<code>error : ""vector"" is ambiguous</code>)</p>

<p>I guess it maybe because the way I include it.</p>

<p>On the document of <code>Dlib</code>, it says, </p>

<p><code>Again, note that you should not add the dlib folder itself to your compiler's include path. Doing so will cause the build to fail because of name collisions (such as dlib/string.h and string.h from the standard library). Instead you should add the folder that contains the dlib folder to your include search path and then use include statements of the form #include &lt;dlib/queue.h&gt;. This will ensure that everything builds correctly.</code></p>

<p>But I am not clear what it means above. I googled <code>the Visual Studio search path (Tools / Options / Projects and Solutions / VC++ Directories).</code>. But in my project this is non-editable.</p>

<p>I only use optimization.h in dlib. If I delete 'using namespace dlib;', then ' typedef matrix column_vector;'then the error is <code>matrix</code> is not a template. If I keep 'using namespace dlib;' I have error ""vector"" is ambiguous`.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;dlib/optimization.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;


using namespace std;
using namespace dlib;

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// In dlib, the general purpose solvers optimize functions that take a column
// vector as input and return a double.  So here we make a typedef for a
// variable length column vector of doubles.  This is the type we will use to
// represent the input to our objective functions which we will be minimizing.

Someone said that ""I tend to not let the supervisor handle back-off"".<br>
Finally they did not tell me clean information and i think i need to know more about supervisor and its duty, etc.
I think that a supervisor is a process that should understand when to restart which child and when to delete which child and when to not restart which child. <strong>Am i right?</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>cd examples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
emmake make
</code></pre>

<p>for the next step, I need to input a bytecode file however, dlib seems to just generate executables which the <code>emcc</code> command will not accept.</p>

<p><strong>My Task in detail:</strong> 
I stored >1.000.000 Objects in my Database ( Polygons, Rectangles and also Circles). The user should be able to select and paint elements by Type/Position ... . 
The selected number of Elements from the user varies from 1 to the max Number of Elements stored in the Database. </p>

<p>Painting a big number of Polygons (>100000) is time consuming. Currently I achieved with my code an improvement of 25%.</p>

<p>How would you speed up the painting process? Where is the mistake?
I would be very grateful for any advice. :)</p>

<p><strong>My Code in detail</strong>
Start loading Objects from SQL DB into an ElementArray. This is done by several loading threads. After loading the first Object, the painting thread begins to transform the Data into an Array of TPoints. Converting Data and also Painting Data is done in several Threads. All processes with one exception (Merging Bitmaps) runs parallel.</p>

An impossible set of object labels was detected. This is happening because none
of the object locations checked by the supplied image scanner is a close enough
match to one of the truth boxes. To resolve this you need to either lower the 
match_eps or adjust the settings of the image scanner so that it hits this 
truth box. Or you could adjust the offending truth rectangle so it can be 
matched by the current image scanner. Also, if you are using the 
scan_image_pyramid object then you could try using a finer image pyramid or 
adding more detection templates. E.g. if one of your existing detection 
templates has a matching width/height ratio and smaller area than the offending
rectangle then a finer image pyramid would probably help. </p>

<p>I couldn't find any problems using either forward slashes or backslashes (or both) when calling this API. I tried the following pathnames:</p>

/foo/bar/baz.dll
c:/foo/bar\\baz.dll

<p>All combinations worked as expected. Why does the MSDN recommend against using forward slashes as path separators?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Regarding UNC Names, it works perfectly well with ""//127.0.0.1/c$/foo/bar/baz.dll"" as well.</p>

<p>And yes if you add ""\?\"" it does not load the library but _wfopen would also fail to open file. How LoadLibraryW is different from any other Windows API accepting/not-accepting forward slashes? Why there are explicit warning regarding LoadLibraryW and not CreateFileW.</p>

"54196526","<p>I have a problem and I do not know how to solve it. I am working with PHP and the TDLib library to manage the Telegram API, for this, I make asynchronous calls through the JSON interface:</p>

<p><a href=""https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/getting-started#tdlib-interface"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/getting-started#tdlib-interface</a></p>

<p>The Telegram API works through updates. The program receives the Telegram updates that must be answered properly in the order they are received. For this, I have a script with a 'while' cycle that works correctly for me. Here is an example of the algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>void *client = td_json_client_create();
// somehow share the client with other threads, which will be able to send requests via td_json_client_send
const double WAIT_TIMEOUT = 10.0; // seconds
int is_closed = 0;  // should be set to 1, when updateAuthorizationState with authorizationStateClosed is received
while (!is_closed) {
  const char *result = td_json_client_receive(client, WAIT_TIMEOUT);
  if (result) {
    // parse the result as JSON object and process it as an incoming update or an answer to a previously sent request
  }
}
td_json_client_destroy(client);
</code></pre>

<p>Well, the problem is that at any given time the update status of the API is <em>""Waiting for phone number""</em>, at which time the user should be asked for the phone number. Subsequently, after several update states, Telegram sends a code to that phone number, so again my application must request the user to enter the received code when the status of the API is <em>""Waiting for the code""</em>.</p>

<p>For this, I programmed <strong>two forms</strong>, one to request the phone number and another to request the code. The problem is that the forms <strong>are not shown until the script finishes</strong>, which does not help.</p>

<p>I tried to handle the flow of the script with <em>break</em> or <em>return</em> as the case may be, and this time I get the forms displayed at the right time, but the expected execution of the script ends, after sending the forms it becomes to execute all the code from the beginning, restarting the variables.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope I have explained correctly and so that someone can give me better advice because I am really lost.</p>

"43902756","<p>I'm loading opencv dlls dynamically using LoadLibrary. The operation fails frequently when letting the code run, but succeeds when stepping through the code.</p>

<p>Here is how I import the dlls</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")]

static extern uint SetErrorMode(uint uMode);
[DllImport(""Kernel32.dll"")]

<p>Here is the code used to load the dlls.</p>

<pre><code>// called once
SetErrorMode(SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS);

// called for each dll string name in a loop
var p = Path.Combine(opencvDirectory, filename);
LoadLibrary(p);
var error = GetLastError();
// repeat with next file
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried putting a <code>Thread.Sleep(1000);</code> before each line, which does not help. If I break on, and step over <code>LoadLibrary(p);</code>, it succeeds every time. It seems to make no difference how much time I wait before stepping over the line.</p>

<p>If it matters, I am loading 45 opencv dlls. When I repeat the automatic loop, it loads the first 12 in the list, then the next 6, then it won't load any more on any subsequent run (27 remaining). This appears to be consistent. However if I step over the code at this point, file by file, I am able to load all the rest.</p>

"44550975","<p>I have been using dlib object detection successfully on mac. Now I want to use it in an iOS app. However, after spending countless hours, dlib object detector always returns zero rectangles. </p>

<pre><code>        ifstream fin(dataDir + ""/object_detector.svm"", ios::binary);
        typedef dlib::scan_fhog_pyramid&lt;dlib::pyramid_down&lt;6&gt; &gt; image_scanner_type;
        dlib::object_detector&lt;image_scanner_type&gt; detector;
        dlib::deserialize(detector, fin);

        vector&lt;dlib::rectangle&gt; dets = detector(dlibImage);
</code></pre>

<p>To make sure it’s not due to a different image, I am using exact same image for which detector returns 1 hit on mac. I have also printed uchar from part of the image in both mac and iOS, and it’s returning same values. So image data is exactly the same. </p>

<p>Probably dlib library is not built correctly for iOS. I have tried multiple approaches for this. From /example/build dir, below command was invoked.</p>

<pre><code>    cmake -G Xcode ..
    cmake --build . --config Release
</code></pre>

<p>It generated dlib.xcodeproj project in dlib_build dir. I opened the project in xcode, changed architecture to iOS (armv7, arm64) and rebuild the library. This library was linked to my project. I got zero results with this approach. dlib was built in debug mode; I did not get any assertion errors.</p>

<p>Second approach tried was to use dlib/all/source.app in my project. I used all the proprocessing flags that are used by cmake or dlib.xcodeproj project. No errors, but still no matches.</p>

<p>I have compared build settings of my xcode project with examples.xcodeproj generated by cmake and it’s same. Also checked the xcode project from <a href=""https://github.com/zweigraf/face-landmarking-ios"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/zweigraf/face-landmarking-ios</a>, but no help.</p>

<p>Strange thing is detector takes couple of seconds to process and comes back with zero matches. So it’s doing something. I wish there was a debug logging that I can turn on for the detector.</p>

<p>I am out of ideas. Will appreciate if anyone can help. dlib is a wonderful library, I just wish it would have been easier to work with on iOS.</p>

"18493416","<p>I'm developing a dll and I need to know some information of the process where it will be attached to, to take desitions whether I hook calls to some functions or not. For instance, if process is explorer.exe I don't want to do anything of that, just when the process is firefox.exe. To set up global hooks I use the ""AppInit_DLLs infrastructure"" so the Operating System is who calls LoadLibrary, not the process explicitely. The hook process take place in DllMain, so there is where I need the information.</p>

<p>Let me explain to you my goals:</p>

<p>I have an app on a raspberry pi with a webcam. If I start the app it will take a picture of the person infront.
Now it should send this picture to my openface app and check, if the face is known. <em>Known</em> in this context means, that I already added pictures of this person to openface before.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I need to train openface before, or could I just put the images of the persons in a directory or s.th. and compare the webcam picture on the fly with these directories?</li>
<li>Do I compare with images or with a generated .pkl?</li>

"42372198","<p>I have a Delphi (Windows) application created using Delphi 10 that has some blocking calls that I would like to convert to using threads.  Unfortunately for me, these are not procedures, but functions.  (And information on how to return function results from threads appears to be much more limited.)  I am trying to familiarize myself with the OmniThreadLibrary, since it seems to be the most flexible and best supported threading library for Delphi, but I'm having trouble with understanding how to do this.</p>

<p>I have been able to get the various OmniThreadLibrary routines to work well with procedures, but when I try to set up a function, I get an error about capturing the result.  When I use OmniThreadLibrary's Future example as a starting point, I can get the function to work, but I can't figure out how to connect to the event monitor, how to send messages from the task, etc.  So, it seems as if I'm overlooking something no matter which way I try to solve this problem.</p>

<p>Currently, my program does something like this:</p>

<pre><code>If myPing(IPAddress) then
begin
  //Do other things here…
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Because myPing is blocking, and I actually need it to wait until myPing returns true before processing further, the application gets sluggish during this process.  I'd like to put the myPing call in a thread, which would solve the sluggishness problem, but I can't figure out how to do that in the form of a function using OmniThreadLibrary.  (Unless I use a future, in which case I can't figure out how to connect to the Event Monitor.)</p>

<p>Edit 1:  Since my original post, I have made a little progress.  I was able to connect the Event Monitor to the Future by adding Parallel.TaskConfig.MonitorWith(Form1.OmniEventMonitor1) to my code, right after the function.  However, I still can't figure out how to send messages to that event monitor from within the Future function.</p>

<p>Edit 2:  I now have some sample code.  My first attempt was similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>function myPing(HostName: string): IOmniFuture&lt;boolean&gt;;
begin
  Result := Parallel.Future&lt;boolean&gt;(function: boolean
  begin
    Result := False;
    //Do actual ping here...  Set Result := True if successful.
  end
  );
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The basic function worked, but did not allow me to send any messages to the TOmniEventMonitor.  I was able to get that part working by changing the code to this:</p>

<pre><code>function myPing(HostName: string): IOmniFuture&lt;boolean&gt;;
begin
  Result := Parallel.Future&lt;boolean&gt;(function: boolean
  begin
    Result := False;
    //Do actual ping here...  Set Result := True if successful.
  end,
  Parallel.TaskConfig.MonitorWith(Form1.OmniEventMonitor1)
  );

I am trying to animate the face of a 3D virtual character in realtime using opencv, dlib, and webcam data similar to fancy applications such as <a href=""https://facerig.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this software</a></p>

<p>Following the <a href=""https://www.learnopencv.com/head-pose-estimation-using-opencv-and-dlib/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example here</a> and using a webcam, I can get realtime 2D facial landmark data in screen space and also an estimation of the 3D translation data of the head pose. But what I would really like to know is the estimated 3D world coordinates of the facial landmarks. For example, when the head is tilted 30 degrees to the side, the mouth appears the same as if the actor was making a ""w"" sound with his/her mouth.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what the strategy is for turning these 2d facial landmarks into 3D data using the estimated head pose, or is this what makes these realtime face animation applications so expensive?</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""kernel32.dll"", SetLastError = true, CharSet = CharSet.Auto)]
public static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string dllToLoad);
</code></pre>

<p>This is my configuration. The calling assembly (<strong>A</strong>) is compiled in x64 and it calls another assembly (<strong>B</strong>) compiled as AnyCPU. From <strong>B</strong> I call <code>LoadLibrary(dll_C_Path)</code> to a library <strong>C</strong> that is 64-bit. All this works on my machine running Win10 64-bit, but it fails on another machine running Win7 64-bit with the following error (after calling <code>GetLastError</code>): <em>""%1 is not a valid Win32 application""</em>. </p>

<p>On <strong>B</strong>, before calling <code>LoadLibrary</code> I've verified that <code>Environment.Is64BitProcess=true</code>. I've opened the library <strong>C</strong> with DependencyWalker and it appears 64-bit. But the most strange thing to me is that on one machine works while on another not. What can be the cause?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I'm passing the full absolute path to <code>LoadLibrary</code>. Here below a screenshort from Depency Walker (library <strong>C</strong> is aec.dll). I'm not used to it, but one thing I noticed is that the msvcr120.dll, which aec.dll depends on, has not the icon of a 64-bit. Can this give some hint?</p>

<p>but what if the dll is already loaded? i know you can use LoadLibrary + IMAGE_DOS_HEADER + IMAGE_NT_HEADERS to retrieve certain information such as the function names etc. i noticed that IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER has different version fields such as MajorImageVersion &amp; MinorImageVersion etc. i tried pretty much everything, but those fields are not always set and when they are, they dont match the values returned by GetFileVersionInfo. so im guessing im looking in the wrong place. any ideas?</p>

<p>And the way the model can be saved in cpp is <a href=""http://dlib.net/svm_c_ex.cpp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code>serialize(""svm.dat"") &lt;&lt; df;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to load this model in c++ using something like this:
`</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;dlib/svm.h&gt;
typedef matrix&lt;float, 40, 1&gt; sample_type;
typedef linear_kernel&lt;sample_type&gt; kernel_type;

svm_c_trainer&lt;kernel_type&gt; trainer;
deserialize(""svm_c.svm"") &gt;&gt; trainer;

<p>How can I save the model in python to a <code>.svm</code> or <code>.dat</code> file so I can deserialize it in C++. Or is there another way to get the model from python to C++.</p>

"53733123","<p>In our environment our main application uses MS Access for a front-end. The back-ends are Access, MySQL and MariaDB. Some of the routines we need are only available in C# so we have to be able to call .NET dll routines from VBA. I did some testing with registered dlls (using RegASM) and it worked fine. However, for the installs on client machines, we really need to be able to get to the shared dlls WITHOUT registering them.</p>

<p>I have been trying to get dynamically loaded libraries in MS Access VBA to work for a long time now. I thought I was close when I found this example: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37074533/canonical-how-to-call-net-methods-from-excel-vba"">Canonical: How to call .NET methods from Excel VBA</a></p>

<p>I typed in the example verbatim and built it using Visual Studio 2017 Community. Then I tried to run it in two different test environments. The first was a Windows 7 Pro (64 bit) box with MS Office Pro 2010 (32 bit). The second test box has Windows 10 Pro (64 bit) and MS Office 2016 Pro (64 bit). The result was the same on both, except for the error number/message. </p>

<p>Here is the sample code from the above link (I hope reposting the snippet is not a breach of etiquette. I wanted to make this post easier to follow):</p>

<pre><code>[ComVisible(true), ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.AutoDual)]
public class YOUR_MAIN_CLASS
{
    [return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.BStr)]
    public string FN_RETURN_TEXT(string iMsg)
    {

        return ""You have sent me: "" + iMsg + ""..."";
    }
}


static class UnmanagedExports
{
    [DllExport]
    [return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.IDispatch)]
    static Object YOUR_DLL_OBJECT()
    {
        return new YOUR_MAIN_CLASS();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the VBA code. The only difference is that I did not use the ""PtrSafe"" qualifier in the Access 2010 32 bit test, but I did use it for the Access 2016 64 bit Access test. I set the Visual Studio Platform Target to x86 for the test with 32 bit Access and to x64 for the 64 bit Access. Other than that, everything was the same. </p>

<pre><code>Option Compare Database

    Dim mObj As Object

    Debug.Print mObj.FN_RETURN_TEXT(""Testing..."")

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>When the code is run, the errors always occur at the ""Set mObj"" line. </p>

<p>In the Access 2010 32 bit test, the error is:</p>

<p>Run-time error '49':
Bad DLL calling convention</p>

<p>In the Access 2016 64 bit test, the error is:</p>

<p>Run-time error '424':

<p>On both tests, I ran DumpBin and the result seemed fine:</p>

<p>Based upon a few other posts here on stackoverflow, I also experimented with the CallingConvention parameter on the DllExport but the result was always the same. I was very surprised that I couldn't get the example to work as I had entered it directly from the other post and I double-checked to make sure it was copied correctly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Is there some weird Windows security feature that might be blocking my application from loading it? That's the only thing I can think of but I can't find any definitive answers.</p>

"17674013","<p>I'm having some troubles about using a shared library (.so) in an Android application.
I have 3 projects:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Native code project => build c++ files in .so library
Let's call it <strong>libNative.so</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Android library project => calls the native code. The output of this project is a .jar file.
Let's call it ""<strong>stack.jar</strong>""</p></li>
<li><p>Android application sample which uses the android library project.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the sample application (3) libraries' properties tab, I configured the stack.jar file to be linked with the .so library. My .so native library is well included in the generated APK.
=> Eclipse copies it in the ""<strong>lib</strong>/armeabi"" folder.</p>

<p>If I launch the APK on a phone, I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Couldn't load libNative:
findLibrary returned null at
java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary(Runtime.java:365) at
java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:535)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing the error is that Eclipse copies the .so library in a lib folder instead of <strong>libs</strong> , and that System.loadLibrary is looking for the path <strong>libs/armeabi</strong>..., right ? Or I may be totally wrong !</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your help,</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: when I install the APK, the .so lib is well copied in <strong>data/data/mypackage/lib</strong> folder. Still, I can't load it. Is it because the load is happening in the .jar file and not directly in the application sample ??</p>

"36246388","<p>I am working on a program in C++ which should detect faces from webcam stream, than crop them using face landmarks and swap them.</p>

<p>I programmed face detection using OpenCV and Viola-Jones face detection. Works fine. Than I searched for how to segment just face from ROI. I tried few skin detection implementations but none was successful.</p>

<p>Than I found dlib face landmarks. I decided to try it. Just in beginning I faced problems because I had to convert <code>cv::Mat</code> to <code>cv_image</code>, Rect to rectangle etc. So I tried to do it just with dlib. I just get stream using <code>cv::VideoCapture</code> and than I wanted to show what is captured using dlib <code>image_window</code>. But here was the problem it was reeeealy slow. Down is used code. Commented lines are lines which do that same but using OpenCV. OpenCV is much more faster, smooth, continuous than code which is not commented whis is like 5 FPS. That's horrible. I can't imagine how slow it will be when I apply face detection and face landmarks.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong? How can I make it faster? Or should I use OpenCV for video capture and showing?</p>

<pre><code>cv::VideoCapture cap;
image_window output_frame;

if (!cap.open(0))
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ""ERROR: Opening video device 0 FAILED."" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return -1;
}

cv::Mat cap_frame;
//HWND hwnd;
do
{
    cap &gt;&gt; cap_frame;

    if (!cap_frame.empty())
    {
        cv_image&lt;bgr_pixel&gt; dlib_frame(cap_frame);
        output_frame.set_image(dlib_frame);
        //cv::imshow(""output"",dlib::toMat(dlib_frame));
    }

    //if (27 == char(cv::waitKey(10)))
    //{
    //  return 0;
    //}

    //hwnd = FindWindowA(NULL, ""output"");
} while(!output_frame.is_closed())//while (hwnd != NULL);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
After switching to Release mode showing capured frames becomes fine.
But I go on and tried to do <strong>face detection</strong> and <strong>shape prediction</strong> with <strong>dlib</strong> just like in example here <a href=""http://dlib.net/face_landmark_detection_ex.cpp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dlib.net/face_landmark_detection_ex.cpp.html</a>. It was quite laggy. So I turned off shape prediction. Still ""laggy.</p>

<p>So I assumed face detection is slowing it down. So I <strong>tried face detection using OpenCV</strong> because it was <strong>significantly better than dlib detector</strong>. I needed to convert detected cv::Rect to dlib::rectangle. I used this.</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;dlib::rectangle&gt; dlib_rois;
long l, t, r, b;

for (int i = cv_rois.size() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--)
{
    l = cv_rois[i].x;
    t = cv_rois[i].y;
    r = cv_rois[i].x + cv_rois[i].width;
    b = cv_rois[i].y + cv_rois[i].height;
    dlib_rois.push_back(dlib::rectangle(l, t, r, b));
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this combination of <strong>OpenCV face detection</strong> and <strong>dlib shape prediction</strong> become brutal laggy. It takes about <strong>4s to process single frame.</strong></p>

<p>I can't figure out why. OpenCV face detection was absolutely fine, dlib shape prediction doesn't seem to be hard to process. Can somebody help me with?</p>

<pre><code>-- We couldn't find the right version of boost python.  If you installed boost and you are still getting this error then you might have installed a version of boost that was compiled with a different version of visual studio than the one you are using.  So you have to make sure that the version of visual studio is the same version that was used to compile the copy of boost you are using.
--  Set the BOOST_ROOT and BOOST_LIBRARYDIR environment variables before running cmake.
--  E.g.  Something like this:
--     set BOOST_ROOT=C:\local\boost_1_57_0
--     set BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:\local\boost_1_57_0\stage\lib
--
--  You will also likely need to compile boost yourself rather than using one of the precompiled
--  windows binaries.  Do this by going to the folder tools\build\ within boost and running
--  bootstrap.bat.  Then run the command:
--     b2 install
--  And then add the output bin folder to your PATH.  Usually this is the C:\boost-build-engine\bin
--  folder. Finally, go to the boost root and run a command like this:
--     b2 -a --with-python address-model=64 toolset=msvc runtime-link=static
--  When it completes, set BOOST_LIBRARYDIR equal to wherever b2 put the compiled libraries.
--  Note that you will need to set the address-model based on if you want a 32 or 64bit python library.
--
--  Next, when you invoke cmake to compile dlib you may have to use cmake's -G option to set the
--  64 vs. 32bit mode of visual studio.  Also, if you want a Python3 library you will need to
--  add -DPYTHON3=1.  You do this with a statement like:
--     cmake -G ""Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64"" -DPYTHON3=1 ..\..\tools\python
--  Rather than:
--     cmake ..\..\tools\python
--  Which will build a 32bit Python2 module by default on most systems.

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> compiled the program using the 64-bit dll in 64-bit.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have a dll that I made called <code>mydll.dll</code>. I have been able to compile the <code>.cpp</code> file outside of VS2013 and was able to load the dll. Once I try to make the same <code>.cpp</code> file in VS2013 and <code>LoadLibrary(mydll.dll)</code> with the dll in the same folder as my <code>.cpp</code> it cannot find the dll, and even if I path directly to the dll it still will not work.</p>

<p>My dll has been shown to work outside of VS2013 so I do not believe that is the source of the problem. The likely source is my ignorance.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<p>(Main.cpp)</p>

<pre><code>int main(void){
    HINSTANCE dllHandle;
    dllHandle = LoadLibrary(""mydll.dll"");
    if (!dllHandle){
        printf(""dll no load\n"");

<p>Which brings up the following doubt:</p>

<p>I think that the lookup rules quoted above say it's going to be <code>c:\execdir</code> because that's allegedly ""the directory where the executable module for the current process is located"", but it would be nice to get a confirmation from another source.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Also, is <code>c:\dlldir\</code> looked at <em>at all</em>? After all, it's neither where the .exe is located, nor the ""current directory"" (if that is meant in the general sense).</p>

I couldn't find a good reference something similar to C# async-await like simple approach in Delphi. Using Omni Thread library seems a good idea for me.</p>

<p>A simple example will be a great start for me.</p>

<p>Sample approach:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TForm1.button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  // notify before starting the task
  memo1.Lines.Add('calling a asynchronous function..');

  // call to the function that takes some time and returns a string value
  memo1.Lines.Add(GetMagicString);

  // notify that the task has been completed
  memo1.Lines.Add('Results fetched successfully.');
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the function <strong>GetMagicString</strong> should process the result asynchronously. Once the result is obtained, only then the program should notify that the task has been completed. By the way, I'm using Delphi-XE.</p>

<p>Edit1:
Here is what I tried. But I am still unable to figure out the proper way to make the job done. The problem is how to return the value.</p>

<pre><code>  .....

"8123360","<p>I am creating a Delphi application to download files from the Internet and if the server supports range requesting it will be multi threaded. The progress is also relayed back to the GUI.</p>

<p>The current software model uses <code>TThread</code> components. The GUI calls a <code>TDownloadThread</code> which then spawns the <code>TDownloadPartThreads</code> - these are the threads which actually do the downloading over 'WinHttp'.</p>

<p><strong>My problem</strong>: The CPU is used up, even for one download where there are only 4 threads downloading.</p>

<p><strong>My Supposed Causes:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I am writing to the destination file every 8192 bytes, and was
wondering if I should buffer it before writing in one block?</li>
<li>The thread communication is done via <code>Synchronize(MainForm.UpdateProgress(Downloaded, TotalSize))</code> which I have heard is AWFUL to do, maybe I should share an object between the threads so I can access this using a timer on the main form, to update progress?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My Solutions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stagger the file writing and only write every <code>x</code> bytes.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the <code>TThread</code> components to use <code>OmniThreadLibrary</code> and send the data back to the main form somehow. Each <code>TDownloadPart</code> thread would then become an <code>IOmniWorker</code> and send back its progress by sharing an object with the main form. The main form would then use a timer to update its progress, like: <code>ProgressBar1.Position := sharedDataObject.Progress;</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully someone can point me in the right direction!</p>

<p>As you can see from <code>prototypes</code> sub-function, <code>handle</code> is marshaled as <code>int32</code>, <code>format</code> as <code>cstring</code> and <code>info</code> as <code>stringPtrPtr</code>.

<p>I've tried many other marshaling types but could not figure out how to obtain correct value for <code>info</code>.</p>

<p>NB: It is not reported here, but the native library also defines a function to free the memory allocated for <code>info</code> argument. My Matlab version is 7.2.0.232</p>

"44152136","<p>I noticed a strange behaviour with the trainer.set_synchronization_file().
As far as I undersood (according to trainer_abstract.h and implementation in trainer.h), it saves the current status of the trainer (inc net) so that we can stop the training at some point and restart from the exact same step.
However when using the example dnn_metric_learning_on_images_ex.cpp (from master b4a54490783). If I stop the training (e.g. ctrl+c) and then restart, the loss is decreasing significantly, as if some momentum was reset or so, and SGD is finding a better path for improvement.
As anybody an idea?
Here is some code sample. Only the stopping criteria is updated after synchronisation.</p>

<pre><code>dnn_trainer&lt;net_type&gt; trainer(net, sgd(0.0001, 0.9), {1,0});
trainer.set_learning_rate(0.1);
trainer.be_verbose();
trainer.set_synchronization_file(""face_metric_sync"", std::chrono::minutes(5));
trainer.set_iterations_without_progress_threshold(10000);
// data loaders (...)
while(trainer.get_learning_rate() &gt;= 1e-5)
{
    qimages.dequeue(images);
    qlabels.dequeue(labels);
    trainer.train_one_step(images, labels);
}

<p>What's stranger is that there is a specific class that blows up this code.  When I commented out the constructor to this class the library loads fine.  I've verified that the constructor exists in the resulting library using objdump.  I then proceeded to comment out the code in the constructor and it fails as well.  Here's the offending code in the C++:</p>

<pre><code>// Code
m_pPifFile = new CNPifFile(sPifFilePath);

m_pPifFile-&gt;SetAppType(ENTRY_TYPE);
m_pPifFile-&gt;SetAppFName(sApplicationFilename);

// load the PIF file
if(m_pPifFile-&gt;LoadPifFile())
{
    // PIF file loaded create a new Run App
    // the offending line
    m_pRunAplEntry = new CRunAplEntry(m_pPifFile);
// Code

<p>RunAplEntry.h</p>

"17983516","<p>I've added a hosting interface to a native C++ application which instantiates the CLR, creates a custom appDomainManager, and provides calls to load managed assemblies into the native process. In my native C++ LoadDLL() function I was expecting to be able to test the incoming dll for .net vs C++ by calling LoadLibrary(dllPath) which I assumed would return failure (NULL) for managed assemblies, but I'm finding that it is returning a handle instead (this is with no CLR currently running in the unmanaged process). Is this normal behavior for an unmanaged LoadLibrary() call on a managed assembly? </p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand how LoadLibrary can even find a proper entry point to test in a managed assembly. I know (one possible) way to solve the problem, and the way I'm planning to implement, is simply to use the CLR instance to access the .net reflection APIs and check if the DLL is managed there first...but I'm puzzled by the fact that LoadLibrary() isn't returning failure and I'd like to understand what I'm missing here. Is the behavior undefined, should it always return a handle, or does it depend on the configuration of the managed assembly? Any link to references is appreciated.</p>

"35783705","<p>So I am running into a pretty large headache building my software with CMake.</p>

<p>I am building a third party library statically (dlib) which requires zlib and libpng (both also static, I prebuilt these) libraries to support PNG functionality. The CMakeFile provided by the COTS dlib library is doing a basic:</p>

<pre><code>target_link_libraries( dlib ${dlib_required_libs}) 
</code></pre>

<p>This is making all of its libraries configured as ""general"" libraries, which end up being used for both Release and Debug builds.</p>

<p>This isn't an issue in Linux, but Windows has a lovely ""feature"" of specifying the runtime library (/MT or /MD or /MTd or /MDd). Any mismatches between these flags cause multiple symbol definition errors at link time. i.e. If libpng was built with /MT and my software is using /MTd, they will be incompatible.</p>

<p>To alleviate this, I have two built versions of zlib and libpng. One set using the /MT flag for Release builds and the other /MTd for Debug builds. These happily link into my own software using optimized/debug flags on target_link_libraries where they are used. HOWEVER, dlib (3rd party) is only linking the Release set of the zlib and libpng libs by the way it's CMakeFile has been written.</p>

<p>My main question is, is there a way I can 'override' what dlib is linking without modifying it's provided CMakeFile? 
I attempted overwriting dlib_LIB_DEPENDS and forcing it into the cache out of desperation, to no avail. </p>

"36352453","<p>I have added the following functionality to an existing native C++ application:</p>

<ol>
<li>A 3rd party DLL is loaded via LoadLibraryA(...)</li>
<li>A function pointer is obtained from the DLL via GetProcAddress(...)</li>
<li>The function is called</li>
</ol>

<p>While this basically works (the function is called alight and produces the expected output) there is one major problem: the function call (in 3.) is extremely slow. It takes over 300ms (!) to execute, while it should be less than 1 ms.</p>

<p>So I created a new, blank C++ application and copied the code over. So steps 1 to 3 are executed exactly the same way as in the other application. The function does the same thing and produces the same results. But the execution is much faster: less than 1 ms, as expected.</p>

<p>Some more observations I made:</p>

<ul>
<li>Both results are 100% reproducible.</li>
<li>Both applications seem to have the same compiler/linker settings.</li>
<li>Threading/performance issues don't seem to be the problem, since in both applications the code is executed on the main thread during very low CPU usage (not much else is going on). Also the results are reproducibly, which rules out these kind of timing issues.</li>
<li>Every call into the DLL takes at least 300ms in my first application, while it's fast in the other. Thus the behavior is not limited to a single function.</li>
<li>It makes no difference if I use a debug or release build.</li>

"34958285","<p>Many years ago in the old forum I asked Primozh if Pipeline pattern can be kind of Uroboros, feeding half-complete results back to itself.</p>

<p>Back then Primozh said it would be straight-forward and PipeLine stage can feed OmniValues not only to the OUTPUT but to INPUT too.</p>

<p>The problem is that initial feeding stages are run way too fast, they expire and seal the INPUT collection and there is no way to UN-SEAL it, and thus as soon as they try to feed half-baked packets back to themselves - voila! - OTL throws ""cannot add to completed collection"" exception.</p>

<p>So how can this self-exploding task by the link above be implemented via self-feeding <code>Pipeline</code> pattern?</p>

<p>UPD: Changed the example from ""self-exploding"" - generating huge amounts of intermediate half-calculated results - permutations generation, to a simple (i hope) calculating of factorial. This however has disadvantage of determinism: it always generate ONE intermediate job item, so the ability of pipeline to deal with growing collections was not tasted.</p>

<pre><code>{$A+} // not $A8
type FactTask = record
  Goal, Curr: Cardinal;
  Value : Int64;
end;

procedure TForm6.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
var Msg: string;
    f: FactTask;
    Results: TArray&lt;Int64&gt;;
    pipeOut: IOmniBlockingCollection;
    pipe:    IOmniPipeline;
begin
  lblResults.Caption := ' WAIT, we are producing...';
  Repaint;

  pipe := Parallel.Pipeline;
  f.Goal := edLen.Value; // 10
  f.Curr := 0;
  f.Value := 1;

  pipe.Stage(
     procedure ( const input, output: IOmniBlockingCollection )
     begin
       output.Add( TOmniValue.FromRecord( f ) );
     end
  );

  pipe.Stage(
     procedure ( const input, output: IOmniBlockingCollection )
     var f_in, f_out: FactTask; v: TOmniValue;
     begin
       for v in input do begin
         f_in := v.ToRecord&lt;FactTask&gt;;
         if f_in.Curr &lt; f_in.Goal then begin
            f_out.Goal := f_in.Goal;
            f_out.Curr := Succ(f_in.Curr);

  pipe.Run;

//    pipe.WaitFor(INFINITE);  ToArray would efficiently do that
//    pipeOut.CompleteAdding;    ...without frozing on Pipeline/Collections SetThrottle

  Msg := IntToStr(f.Goal) + '! = ' + IntToStr(Results[0]);
  lblResults.Caption := Msg;
  ShowMessage(Msg);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>It crashes with the pipeline stage trying to re-fill the input that unexpectedly got sealed by <code>TOmniPipeline.Run</code>.
At the marked line the ""Cannot add to competed collection"" exception is unexpectedly thrown.</p>

<p>How to keep the Pipeline running when collection is balancing between empty and few ( it is not only the starting condition, it would be repeated near the calculations end )?</p>

"45279535","<p>I am new in OpenCV an dlib, and I am not sure if my designe is correct. I want to write C++ face detector for android phone wich should detect faces with differents phone orientation and rotatrion angles. Lets stay when phone orientation is portrait and landscape. I am using OpenCV to rotate/edit image and dlib to detect faces. dlib shape predicats initialized with shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat and it can detect face only in correct phone orientation (it means if I rotate phone by 90 it can not detect face.)
To make possible detect faces I read axis from accelerometor and rotate source image to correct orientation before send it to dlib face detector and it detects ok, but output coordinates in dlib::full_object_detection shape of course matchs to rotated picture but not original. So it means i have to convert (rotate landmarks) to back to original image.</p>

<p>Is there are any existing API in dlib or OpenCV to make possible rotate landmarks (dlib::full_object_detection) for specified angle? It will be good if you can provide some example.</p>

"45435314","<p>I am loading the JNI libraries using <code>System.loadLibrary(""xyz"")</code> and it works fine. But the thing is, when using <code>java.lang.System.load()</code> to load a library, <em>an attacker can replace or modify the original file with a malicious one</em> if the full path of the dynamic library is specified in a world readable location (such as the SDCard). This can result in the loading of untrusted content into the Dalvik VM.</p>

<p>So this can be fixed using fully qualified path to the target library. For some reason I am not able to get succeed in providing fully qualified path.</p>

<p>Below are the things I tried but no luck.</p>

<pre><code>System.load (""xyz"")

System.load (""/src/main/jni/lib/xyz"")

System.load (""/system/lib/xyz"")
</code></pre>

<p>Can someone please suggest where I am going wrong.</p>

"53931713","<p>I have some images, which I annotated using MATLAB's <code>imageLabler</code> tool. As a result I got gtruth.mat file (which contains annotations of all of the images). </p>

<p>Now I would like to train a simple object detector using these annotations. However, the object detector that I am using (dlib object detector), only accepts XML format.</p>

<p>Is it possible to convert that <code>.mat</code> file into an XML file, so that my all annotations remain intact and I can train my custom object detector? If so, how can I do that?</p>
